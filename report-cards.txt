Shujing:

joy

$ is very funny. She has a playful nature and a great sense of humor.

$ is creative. She often has interesting solutions for her math problems.

One of Shujing's weaknesses is calculations.
Sometimes, Shujing makes simple mistakes.

But I know Shujing knows how to do it.
All she needs to do is focus more, and I know 100%, these simple mistakes will disappear.

Anderson:

joy

Anderson brings a fun sense of humor to class. When we do math readings, Anderson often reads with an australian accent that makes all of his classmates laugh.

When Anderson is in the mood, he does excellent work.
On these days, he is super productive and it is wonderful.

Sometimes during class, Anderson likes to brag.
I hope Anderson will brag a little bit less.

$ is a strong student.
But the secret to growing stronger and stronger and stronger is to be humble.

Alexander:

joy
rebel

caring
When Anderson's shoe isn't tied, Alexander ties it for him.
When one coloring picture is saved for Felix, Alexander takes it out of the pile and gives it to the teacher so that no one else take Felix's picture.
When the classroom board is dirty, Alexander will often wipe it down, even when the teacher doesn't want him to.

When Alexander wants to be, he can be a very mature young man.
Mr. Lee is always happy to see it.

Bonnie does good neat work.
She has excellent handwriting.
She has many different colored pens that she likes to write with.

Sometimes Bonnie talks too much to her friends.
But most of the time, Bonnie is a very good student.

Bonnie is capable of a lot.
I hope she will push herself 1 inch further because she can definitely do it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stephen:


Stephen is wonderful.
Stephen has a fun sense of humor and brings a happy feeling to the class.

Sometimes Stephen goofs off too much, but for the most part, Stephen's classroom behavior has been excellent.

For this exam, Stephen could've done much better.
Stephen usually does very well with fractions.
Somehow on this exam, Stephen seems to have forgotten it.


Stephen doesn't show much work and still often gets the answer correct. This is a bad habit. For 4th grade, it is okay. But math will get much harder. Showing work is a very important skill.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Felix:

Felix is a good student who cares very much about his work.
He often asks questions, and after school, will do extra work with the teacher.

Sometimes, Felix does not get a good score on quizzes or exams.
However, Felix is very capable of doing them. One time, he solved a super long division question over 10 digits that he wrote all for himself.

When Felix is focused and attentive, Felix's abilities are much stronger.

I know Felix will do much better on the next exam.
We will do extra practice and make it happen.

Jayden:

Usually, Jayden is sweet, caring, and wonderful. 
Sometimes, Jayden is a grumpy potato.

But that's okay.
