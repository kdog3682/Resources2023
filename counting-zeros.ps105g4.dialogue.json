    "Hao Xiang",
    "Evangeline, that means your name is Ms. Evangeline since you’re the teacher."
  ],
  [
    "Alvin",
    "Ms. Evangeline, can I also be the teacher?"
  ],
  [
    "Evangeline",
    "Of course Mr. Alvin."

    "Mr. Alvin, can I also be the teacher?"
  ],
  [
    "Alvin",
    "Of course Ms. Michelle."
  ],
  [
    "Michelle",
    "Great. Today, we will learn about multiplication with zeroes."

    "Daniel",
    "That’s my favorite!"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "That’s my favorite too!"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Mr. Daniel, do you want to teach them how to do it?"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Of course Mr. Daniel. let’s do it."
  ],
  [
    "Emily",
    "No! I want to teach it."
  ],
  [
    "lucas",
    "Wait a minute. You can’t all be teachers. Who’s going to be the students?"
  ],

    "I’ll be a student."
  ],
  [
    "Hao Xiang",
    "And I as well!"

    "Everyone, it is time to begin. Ms. Emily, go ahead."
  ],
  [
    "Emily",
    "20 Times 30. Mr. Daniel what should we do first?"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "The first step is to forget about the zeroes. Mr. Daniel, what is 2 times 3?"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "That’s a fantastic question Mr. Daniel. 2 times 3 equals 6."
  ],
  [
    "Emily",
    "Good job Mr. Daniel. The second step is to count the zeroes."
  ],
  [
    "Michelle",
    "There are 2 zeroes. 20 has 1 zero. And 30 has 1 zero."
  ],
  [
    "Emily",
    "Thank you Ms. Michelle. And finally for the last step. Ms. Evangeline?"
  ],
  [
    "Evangeline",
    "The final step is to put the zeroes on. The final answer is a 6 with 2 zeroes. The answer is 600."
  ],
  [
    "Lucas",
    "Does that mean 30 times 40 equals 1200 because 3 times 4 = 12 and there are 2 extra zeroes?"
  ],
  [
    "Michelle",
    "Great job Lucas."
  ],
  [
    "Lucas",
    "I get it!"
  ],
  [
    "Hao Xiang",
    "I don't get it. Why does this trick work?"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Because it does."
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Excellent explanation Mr. Daniel!"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Thank you Mr. Daniel!"
  ],
  [
    "Hao Xiang",
    "I still don't get it."
  ],
  [
    "Alvin",
    "Don't worry Hao Xiang. You will get it. You just have to do it a few times."
  ],
  [
    "Hao Xiang",
    "Are you sure?"
  ],
  [
    "Alvin",
    "I’m positive."
  ],
  [
    "Grace",
    "Can we do another example?"
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "Of course Grace."
  ],
  [
    "Daniel",
    "What is 9 billion times 200?"
  ],
  [
    "Grace",
    "9 Billion is the same as 9,000,000,000."
  ],
  [
    "Lucas",
    "The first step is to do 9 times 2 which is 18."
  ],
  [
    "Hao Xiang",
    "The second step is to count the zeroes. There are 11 zeroes."
  ],
  [
    "Grace",
    "Finally, we put it all together. The answer is 1,800,000,000,000."
  ],
  [
    "Everyone",
    "Great job everyone!"
