Hi Hammy

----------------

Hi $! How are you?

----------------

im good Hammy
Today, I am practicing big multiplication like 200 * 3000.

----------------

200 times 3000?

But those numbers are so big.
Does it take a very long time to do?

----------------

Nope. It only takes a few seconds.

----------------

Oh $. But how? Will you show me how you do it?

----------------

Of course Hammy.

The first step is to put all of the zeroes into your pocket.
----------------
Are you allowed to do that $?
Won't that change the numbers?
----------------
Trust me hm
----------------

Okay.

200 has 2 zeroes. I'll put the zeroes into my pocket.
3000 has 3 zeroes. I'll put its zeroes into my pocket too.

    @arrow(200, 2)
    @arrow(3000, 3)

----------------
Now that the zeroes are gone, you can do 2 * 3
----------------
2 * 3 equals 6

But 6 can't be the answer. That's way too small.
----------------
Take the zeroes out of your pocket, and put them back onto the 6
----------------
All of the zeroes?
----------------
All of them
----------------
I have 5 zeroes in my pocket right now
Is the final answer a 6 with 5 zeroes?
Is the answer 600,000?
----------------
You did it hm!

----------------

Let's do another one!
----------------
Okay ... try 8000 * 20,000
----------------
8 * 2 equals 16
And hm counts that there are 7 zeroes

$, is the final answer 160,000,000?

----------------
Great job hm! You did it.
I am very proud of you.
----------------
:ham: Thank you $
