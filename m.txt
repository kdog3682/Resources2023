Hammy, no more cakes! 120 cakes is too many cakes!

But Hammy didn't listen. Bonnie's Bakery has the best cakes.
At 9:08PM, Hammy noticed Shujing was soon to fall asleep.
It was time for Ham and Sam's great adventure.
They would sneak off to Bonnie's Bakery for more cakes.

If the journey takes 17 minutes, Sam's bathroom break takes 1 minute, and Ham's snack break takes 3 minutes, what time will Ham and Sam arrive at Bonnie's Bakery?

(9:08PM + 17 + 1 + 3)

# Hammy's Math Investigation

Why Doesn't Mingrui's Math Trick Work?

Hammy was doing homework

21 * 23

1 times 3 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
The answer is 243!

What time is it?
It's Hammy Time.

What ... ?
What's going on?
Why doesn't the Hammy trick work?
But the answer is not 243.
The answer is actually 283.

What's going on? Why is the answer 283?
