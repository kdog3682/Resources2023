Jean throws the ball 9 feet.

Lee throws the ball 3 times farther than Jean.

Three times farther means 3 times 9 which equals 27. Lee throws it 27 feet.

The question wants "d". 

What's "d"?

In the third sentence, the question tells us "d" is the distance Lee throws.

That means d equals 27.

The correct answer choice will be the equation that gives us an answer of 27. The answer is D.

Natasha does 3/5 of her essay in the morning.

Then she does 2/5 in the afternoon.

The denominators are the same so we can add them together. Natasha does in total 2/5 + 3/5 = 5/5.

Evan does 4/5 of his essay.

5/5 - 4/5 = 1/5

The answer is 1/5. Natasha does 1/5 more than Evan.

Rounding a number to 47000.

The middle point will be 500.

For example, 47501 will round up.
But 47499 will round down.

46500 will round up.
But 46499 will round down.

The answer is 46504. It is higher than 500. So it rounds up.

There are 360 degrees in a circle.

Why?

Because there are.

Can you give me a real explanation?

Okay. There are a few explanation. The most popular explanation is ancient greek mathematicians chose 360 as the number of degrees in a circle because 360 is a nice number.

Huh? What do you mean by a "nice number"? Does 360 go around giving flowers to everyone?

We will learn more about 360 later. Right now, we have to do the question. 

The question says 50/360 or 50 out of 360.

Think of that as being 50 slices out of 360 slices of pizza.

So the answer is choice A: 50?

Yup.

Ms. Larsen's first van is $16257.

Right now, 2 is in the HUNDREDS place.


The question says for the second van, the 2 is times TEN.

Times 10 means we need to move the 2 to a higher place value.

Do we move it to the THOUSANDS place?

Exactly. ONES -> TENS -> HUNDREDS -> THOUSANDS.
Right now, we are at HUNDREDS, so the next spot will be THOUSANDS.

That means the answer will have a 2 in the THOUSANDS place. The only answer that has this is Choice A: 12987.

We havent learned how to multiply fractions yet.

Let's learn it right now.
Step 1. First we have to turn the 7 into a fraction.

You can always turn any number into a fraction by dividing it by 1.

The 7 becomes 7/1. 
The 3/4 is still 3/4.

Step 2. Multiply across.

Wait a sec. Don't we need a common denominator?

Only for adding and subtracting. 

Hmm. This seems too easy.

That's what a lot of people say.
Lots of people like multiplying fractions more than adding fractions.

So we just multiply across?

Yes. Do it for the top. And then do it for the bottom.

7/1 * 3/4
The top is 7 * 3 = 21
The bottom is 4 * 1 = 4
Is the answer 21/4 ?

It most certainly is.

But I dont see 21/4 in any of the answer choices.

Simba. You have to look deeper!

I see it! It is choice C. 21 becomes 21/1.
21/1 times 1/4 ends up equaling 21/4.


----------------
q27

Megan's painting is 8 feet wide and 6 feet tall. 

The area is going to be 8 times 6 = 48.

How come?

Because Megan's painting is a rectangle.

Every rectangle has an area of base times height.

The question says Megan's second painting has the SAME area.

That means the second painting also has an area of 48.

Choice A = 8 * 6 = 48. It works!

The question also says the dimensions are different. So we can't use 8 and 6.

5 * 9 = 45. It's not B.
4 * 12 = 48. The answer is C.

----------------
Q28

Jack starts with 60 apples. 

12 of them are turned into apple sauce.

That means Jack only has 60 - 12 = 48 apples.

Then Jack divides his apples into 6 baskets.

The only answer choice which matches this story is Choice B: (60 - 12) div 6.



Q29

For a line plot, the trick is to count the X's.

All of them?

For this one, only the ones that are higher than 4 1/2.

6 plants have a height of 5.
1 plant has a height of 5 1/2.
4 plants have a height of 6.
1 plant has a height of 6 1/2.
@ plants have a height of 7.
In total, 14 plants have a height greater than 4 1/2.


Many of you are going to want to rush through this packet.

Maybe you will feel, "This is easy." I don't need to do this.

Maybe you will feel, "I just want to get it done as fast as possible."

These feelings are real feelings.

It is very normal to feel like this.

You get to hear your classmates read.

You get to hear me read.

And you get to hear me read.

But I'm going to be bored. 

If you feel bored, you can write down all of the prime numbers from 1 to 1000.

That will take too long.
































Many of you probably feel

Ask yourself, why am I rushing through it?

"d" equals 27. Now we have to look for an answer choice which will give us the number 27.










5/8 - 9/20

The denominators have to be the same.
----------------


Yes they do.
----------------


But $, we have a problem. 
There is no way for 8 to become 20.

Look: 8, 16, 24. 

It skips past 20.
----------------


Lets turn 9/20 into 18/40


----------------

Are you allowed to do that?
----------------
Of course.
To make an equivalent fraction, you just multiply the top and bottom by the same number.

9 times 2 becomes 18.
20 times 2 becomes 40.

9/20 and 18/40 are exactly the same.
----------------

hmm. but why are we turning 9/20 into 18/40?
----------------

Remember how you said 8 doesnt go into 20?
----------------
Yeah
----------------
Now it's not 20 anymore.
----------------
Now it is 40 because we turned 9/20 into 18/40.
----------------
Exactly.
8 most definitely goes into 40.

8, 16, 24, 32, 40

----------------

To turn 8 into 40, we multiply by 5.
----------------

Our original fraction was 5/8.

So what do we do?
----------------
We multiply the top and bottom by 5.
----------------
Why?
----------------

Because you can't just multiply the bottom by 5. You have to do the top too.
----------------
But why are we multiplying the bottom by 5?
----------------

That is a very good question.

Let's walk through it from the start
----------------
do we have to?

----------------
yes we do $
----------------
fine

We start with 5/8 - 9/20
----------------
We try to make the 8 go into 20 but it doesnt work.
----------------
So we turn 9/20 into 18/40.
----------------
Now we have 5/8 - 18/40
----------------
8 can go into 40.
----------------
8 goes into 40 FIVE times.
----------------
So we multiply 5/8 by 5 on top, and 5 on bottom.
----------------
now 5/8 becomes 25/40.
----------------
now we can subtract since the denominators are the same.
----------------
 25/40 - 18/40 = 7/40
----------------
the final answer is 7/40

My goal for you is don't do a single comparison.

Save your energy for you.

We will do comparisons later. I promise.

Right now,

Frequently Asked Questions


If I learn something new from the teacher, does that mean the teacher is smarter than me?


I think learning from the teacher is boring.
I would much rather show off because showing off makes me feel good. Shouting out the answer makes me feel good.
So ... why should I learn?

By learning from the teacher, maybe you can learn a few new things to show off.

Student 1: Spends all the time showing off. Learns nothing new.
Students 2: Spends only a little bit of time showing off. Learns 3 new things. 

End result: Student 2 knows 3 more things than student 1.


Teachers think they know everything.
Teachers always say, do this or do that.
Teachers always tell us what to do.
Teachers aren't the boss of me.
I am the boss of me.
Why should I learn from a teacher?

You are going to have about 80 teachers total from kindergarten through college. Sometimes you will like the teacher. Sometimes you won't like the teacher.

But that's life.

But I like it.
I like it a lot.


Some of you might say something like,

Mr. Lee,

No offense, but your special ability is dumb.

title: Turning Mixed Numbers into Improper Fractions
level: 1
----------------

Hi $

Hi $

Did you know that 1 2/3 means 1 + 2/3?

How come $?

Because there is an invisible plus sign between the 1 and 2/3

I dont see it.

Thats because it's invisible.

Are we allowed to add 1 and 2/3 together? 

We are. But first, we need a common denominator.

To get a common denominator, let's turn 1 into 3/3.

Good idea $. We can choose basically anything for 1.
bullet(We can choose $1/$1., range(1, 5))
But the one that we want to choose is 3/3 because this way, it matches the denominator of 2/3.

We start with 1 + 2/3.
We turn the 1 into 3/3.
Now we have 3/3 + 2/3.

The final answer is 5/3!
1 2/3 --> 1 + 2/3 --> 3/3 + 2/3 --> 5/3
