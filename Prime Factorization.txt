Hi everyone. My name is Oscar.

And my name is Owen. Today, Oscar and I are going to teach "Prime Factorization."

The name "Prime Factorization" sounds intimidating. But actually? It's just a fancy way of saying, "break a number into its prime factors."

The prime factorization of 6. Are you ready $?

I was born ready $.
The answer is 2 * 3.

What? That's it?

That's it.

Are you sure?

I am.
2 * 3 equals 6. 
2 is prime.
3 is prime.
The answer is absolutely 2 * 3.

Let's do a harder one.

The prime factorization of 12.

Hmm. Okay.
How about 3 * 4?

You're very close $.

What's wrong?
I know 3 * 4.
I know 3 is prime.
Ahh ... the 4 is not prime. What do I do $

Break the 4.

With a karate chop?

Yes.

Ki-yahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Okay. I broke the 4 into 2 * 2.

Now put it all together.

The final answer is 3 * 4 --> 3 * 2 * 2.

Challenge: What is the prime factorization of 100?

My friends, 100 seems like a big number.

But as with all big things, take it one step at a time.
First, we know 100 = 10 * 10.

Are we done $?

Not yet because 10 is not a prime number.
Let's break the 10 into primes.

10 equals 2 * 5.

There we go. The final answer for the prime factorization of 100 is 10 * 10 --> 2 * 5 * 2 * 5.
