title: Square Roots
level: 1

Hi $,

10 times 10 equals 100.
Going backwards, that means the square root of 100 is 10.

Now it's your turn.
What is the square root of 25?

----------------

So basically, I need a number times itself, to equal 25.
5 * 5 = 25
The square root of 25 is 5!

----------------

Good job $.
That is exactly how you do it.

----------------

Challenge 2: The square root of X is half of the square root of Y. What does X + Y equal?
----------------








Can you think of a number times itself

The square root of a number is just like the square of a number, except you go backwards. You go back to the "root" starting place. For example, the square of 5 is 25. That means the square root of 25 is 5. The square of 9 is 81. Therefore the square root of 81 is 9. The square root of 100 equals x10 because 10 multipled by itself will give you 100.

The most common type of squares and square-roots are called "perfect squares." When someone says the term, "square number", they're referring to a perfect square. A perfect square means there isn't any decimal. 36 is a perfect square because it comes from 6 times 6. 35 is not a perfect square because it comes from 5.916 times 5.916. From 1 to 10, how many numbers are perfect squares? xx9 works because 3 * 3 equals 9. 4 also works. And the last one, is 1 because 1 * 1 equals 1. The answer is 3.

It is difficult to find the square root of numbers that are not perfect squares. 81 is a perfect square. Finding its square root is pretty simple. The answer is just 9 because 9 times 9 equals 81. But what about finding the square root of 80? Maybe the answer is 8.5? Try 8.5 times 8.5 and you get 72.25. Nope. It's too small. Maybe 8.7? 8.7 * 8.7 is 75.69. Nope. Still smaller than 80. 8.9 * 8.9? The answer is 79.21. Still too small. 8.95? The answer is 80.1025. Now we're too big. We have to go a little smaller. Maybe 8.93? 8.93 * 8.93 is 79.7449. Now we're too small again. Basically, it takes forever.

For this reason, you will almost NEVER have to calculate the square root of non-square numbers. Instead, the types of questions you see will probably have estimation or rounding. Here is one example: The square root of 80 is between what two numbers?

One thing that often shows up in square root questions is taking the square root of variables like "x" or "n" or "z * z." What is the square root of y * y? xxOne thing that you can always do is plug in a number. Pretend y equals 4. That means the question turns into "What is the square root of 16?" The answer is 4. Since y equals 4, that means the answer is y. [y, 0.5y, 2y, y/4] 


Very similar to squares and square roots is the idea of cubes and cube roots. Instead of squaring a number, this time you cube the number. Instead of taking the square root, you take the cube root. Instead of calling the answer "area", you call the answer "volume."

The reason for these differences is because a cube is the 3-dimensional version of a square. A square's area is length * width. A cube's volume is length * width * height. Instead of multiplying by yourself twice to get the area (like 5 * 5), you multiply by yourself 3 times (5 * 5 * 5) to get the volume. \\diagram(square, cube)

A cube has a side length of 2. That means the volume of the cube will be 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. A different cube has a side length of 5. The volume of this cube will be x125 because 5 * 5 * 5 equals 125.

This pattern also works going backwards. The square root of 16 is 4 because 4 * 4 = 16. The cube root of 125 is 5 because 5 * 5 * 5 = 125. The cube root of 64 is x4.

Not only does the pattern work going backwards, the pattern works for any number of dimensions. Usually, we only do math in 2 dimensions like the area of a square: length * width, or 3 dimensions like the volume of a cube: length * width * height. But actually, the dimensions can go much higher. You can go to 4 dimensions, 5 dimensions, 10 dimensions. 

A 4-dimensional square is called a tesseract. Follow the pattern that we have seen with a square, a cube, and now a tesseract. If the side-length of a tesseract is 3, what is its 4-dimensional volume? [81]


09-13-2021 Practice Questions
20 questions.


A cube has a volume of 1000. What is the length of 1 of its sides? 
A cube has a volume of 8. If you increase each side of the cube by 1, what will the new volume be?


Of course, they might try to make the question a little harder by doing something like this: X equals 39. Y equals 41. The \\sqrt(X + Y) is between \\mc 8 and 9

First find the side length. The cube root of 8 equals 2. Now that we have the side length, the question says to increases it by 1. The side length is 3 now, which means the final volume will be 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.

A cube has a volume of 27. If the volume of the cube is increased by 37, how much does each side of the cube increase by?



A square is a special type of rectangle where all the sides are the xsame.
A cube is a special type of prism where all the sides are the xsame.
A cube is the 3-D version of a square. A prism is the x3-D version of a rectangle.

The area of a rectangle is length * width.
The volume of a prism is length * width * xheight.

When multiplying fractions, you DO NOT need a xcommon xdenominator. You just multiply the top and then multiply the xbottom.

There is a trick for multiplying fractions. When something on the top, and something on the bottom is exactly the same, you can xcancel them out.

2/2 + 1/2 equals x3/2 because both fractions have a common xdenominator.

A mixed number is when you have a whole-number and a fraction together. For example, 1 and 1/2 is a mixed number. 5 and 2/7 is a mixed number. 





volume of 64. That means the side length of the cube is ___ 

What is the volume of the cube? \\mc8 \\answerhelp The answer is 8 because 2 times 2 times 2 is 8


.




Find the square-root of (10 + 10)(10 + 10).
Find the cube-root of (1 + 5)(2 + 4)(3 + 3).











The basic building blocks of math are addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponents. If you look at this list, it doesn't say the word "square root" anywhere. That's because "squares and square roots" belong to the category of exponents.

In math, there are often multiple ways of writing the same thing. Kind of like if your name is Kaylee. You might also be known as Kay, or Kaykay, or Kayster, or Kayfizzle, or KaySizzle - it's all referring to the same person.

The same is true in math.
5 * 5 means 5 times 5.
Also (5)(5) means 5 times 5.
Also 5 dot 5 means 5 times 5.
5 squared also means 5 times 5.
5^2 (pronounced 5 squared) also means 5 times 5.

You can use the script that has been written for you. Or you can create your own script. No matter how you decide to do it, the end goal is to talk about "fraction decomposition" for 5 minutes with examples and diagrams.

Talking outloud and giving verbal explanations is hard. The reason is because when you are young, the Broca and Wernicke regions of your brain are still not fully developed. 

Have you ever had the feeling where you want to say something, but for some reason, you can't find the words? That's what the Broca and Wernicke regions are responsible for.

By practicing giving verbal explanations, it makes those regions stronger and stronger.

jidan de zhuyao mudi shi



A major paradigm shift when learning Chinese is to place descriptors after the object, not before.
Romantic languages, (english, spanish, french) by and large, will place the descriptor in front. Think of a descriptor as words tagged by "of."

The primary purpose of the eggs is
el objetivo principal [de] los huevos es
le but principal [des] oeufs est

In Chinese, it goes in the opposite direction. You would write it like:

Eggs the primary purpose is
los huevos el objectivo principal es 

jidan = eggs
de = of
zhuyao mudi = primary objective
shi = is

Combining it all together, we get

jidan de zhuyao mudi shi

Listen to this: "Eggs of the primary purpose..." Doesn't that just sound weird? If you write: "zhyao mudi de jidan"... It sounds weird for the exact same reason. Basically, it sounds backwards.

Why? One possible explanation may be that the english "of" points to the object from a third person point of view. "The colors of the rainbow." On the other hand, the Chinese "de" points to the object from a first person point of view. "Wo de xiezi" 

Long story short: In Chinese, the descriptor goes after the object.


"de" can be kind of tricky. It can almost feel like, there are no rules. You can use the "de" here, or there, or anywhere. 


To start talking as soon as possible.

For learners who are familiar with object-oriented programming, the "de" that frequently pops up in Chinese basically has 3 uses, and a lot of the uses are contextual. Much like "this" in coding, it can feel very weird at the start.

Chinese humor.

Chinese humor is a bit different from English humor.

English, filled with a variety of syllables and colorful words, has many jokes based on the sound. 
In other words, much English humor deals with wordplay.

While of course you can do wordplay in Chinese or any language, it is not really how people express humor.

"Just bring yourself."
It's not that funny. 

But it is funny in Chinese.

"Ni ba ni ziji dai lai jiu hao le."

ni = you
ba = sound-filler for action
ziji = you
dai lai = bring
jiu hao le = "then it's good"

It's funny. 
No convincations.

09-15-2021 Algebraic Manipulations

One of the big ideas in math is that you can write the same thing many different ways. You can write 2 + 3 = 5 or you can write 4 + 1 = 5. Or you can write 8 - 3 = 5. Or you can write 5 * 1 = 5. Or you can write 10 / 2 = 5. How many ways of writing 5 are there? It's infinite.

Some students think this is cool. They think, "Wow! Math is so cool! You can write the number 5 infinite different ways. Wowzers!"

Other students think, "This is so dumb. Why? Just ... why?"

99 * 3. Everyone can do this multiplication problem. It just takes some time.

But there is a much better way of doing it. You can do (100 - 1) * 3.

The reason this works is because 99 is the same thing as (100 - 1).


4 * 400 equals x1600. The reason is because you can ignore the ending zeros. Do 4 * 4, and then put the zeros back onto the number.

4 * 0.004 equals x0.016. The reason is because you can ignore the starting decimal zeroes. Just do 4 * 4 which gives you 16. Now, notice there are 3 decimal places. That means you will have to shift the decimal left 3 times.snsn16 => 1.6 => 0.16 => 0.016

0.04 * 400 equals x16. We have 2 leading zeroes from the 400. And we have 2 decimals from the 0.04. Basically, they cancel each other out. So we just do 4 * 4 and the answer is 16.

0.0004 * 40 equals x0.0016. We have 1 leading zero from the 40, and 4 decimals from 0.0004. That means shift RIGHT once, and shift LEFT 4 times, which basically means, shift LEFT 3 times. 

0.00040000000 * 40 equals x0.0016. Trailing decimal zeroes do not count. For example, 16 is the same as 16.0 is the same as 16.00 is the same as 16.000. Therefore, the question is the same as the previous question: 0.0004 * 40, so our answer should be the same too.

0.02 * 0.04 * 0.08 equals x0.000064. In total, there are 6 decimal places, 2 from each of the numbers.We will do 2 * 4 * 8 = 64, and then shift LEFT by 6 decimal places. 


The LCM of 3 and 4 and 5 is x30. 

Step 1. Break each number into its prime factorization.

3 is 3
4 is 2 * 2
5 is 5

Step 2: Put it together.

How many 3s will you need? You will need ONE 3.
How many 2s will you need? You will need TWO 2s.
How many 5s will you need? You will need ONE 5.

A = n * n * n
B = n * n * m 

The LCM of A and B is xn * n * n * m.

How many n's will you need? A needs 3 and B needs 2. The winner is THREE n's.
How many m's will you need? A needs 0 and B needs 1. The winner is ONE m.


A + B equals 8 and A/B equals ${calc(1/7)}. What does A equal?

First, we know that A and B add up to 8. That means the possibilities are going to be:
4 and 4
3 and 5
2 and 6
1 and 7

Going through each possibility the only one that matches ${calc(1/7)} will be 1/7. xThat means A equals 1 or A = 7.


10% of 20 equals x2. You can think of the % sign as meaning "divide by 100." That means we have 10 div 100 * 20. The two zeroes on the top, will cancel with the 2 zeroes on the bottom. So the answer is just 2.

Variable items.





Instead of writing 10 * 10 * 10, you can write 10^3. 
Instead of writing n * n * n * n, you can write xn^4.

Instead of writing 60000, you can write x6 * 10^5. 

0.02 * 0.04 * x = 640. What could x be? Before doing anything, forget about the zeroes, and forget about the decimals. Just look at the numbers. We have 2, 4, and 64. And it's all multiplication. that means the x has to have a 8 in it because 2 * 4 * 8 will give you 64.snsnThat means the answer has to be 8 or 80 or 800 or 8,000 or 80,000, or 800,000. 

0.02 is the same as x2/100. 
0.002 is the same as x2/1000.

Convert it into a fracton.

It takes a really long time to write this big number: (don\'t read it) ${expand(10^10)}. Luckily, we have exponents. ${expand(10^10)} is the same thing as ${expand(10^10, String)}. How many 10s are there? 9 of them. It saves a lot of time and energy to just write

Math is kind of like cooking.
No it's not.
Okay you're right. It's not. But it kind of is.
Can you explain more Kaylee?
Of course I will Aaron.

Basically, there are two types of cookers.
The first type likes to follow step-by-step instructions.
The second type doesn't really like to follow instructions. They just like to throw things in and go with their feelings.

The first type thinks the second type is crazy.
And the second type thinks the first type should be more free.

Which one is better?
It's hard to say.
Everybody has a little bit of both types in them. But everyone probably also has a preference. 
Neither is better. Both types have their merits.

The same is true of math. 


//You know how students always ask, "What is the point of math? When am I ever going to use it?"

There are 3 secrets to becoming good at math.

Secret #1 - Cat pictures. The secret to becoming good at anything is cat pictures.
Secret #2 - Approximating fractions.
Secret #3 - I'll tell you later.

No Elina! Tell me now.

You will have to find a young boy named Daniel. He is in 4th grade. And then you will have to ask his grandfather's grandfather's grandfather. That will be the third and final secret of becoming good at math.

First, you must memorize the basic fractions. There is a list of 20 of them on the next page.
1/1
1/2
1/3
1/4
1/5
1/6
1/7
1/8
1/9
1/10
2/5
3/5
5/6
3/2
5/2
9/4

These are the most fractions which most frequently show up in math.
Convert each of them to decimals.
17/77.

Right away, when I look at 17/77, I kind of pretend it looks like 20/80.



Well, you will use approximating fractions when you go to Costco.

A 12 pack of Mama Ping's Oyster sauce for 9.99?
Or a 15 pack of Lao Gan Ma for 15.99?

Fraction approximation will help you solve this. 

For example, if you've washed rice 1 million times, you probably don't need to measure it out anymore. You can just go with the feel.




In math, 

It is extremely useful.


09-17-2021 fraction-approximations 

Hello everyone. Every time we multiply by 10, we add a 0 to the number.

That's what everyone says. But is there a way to prove it?

Yes. Take a number. 

I choose the number 6!

Now add 6 to itself 10 times. Like this: 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6.

The answer comes out to 60, which is basically the same as adding a zero to the original 6.

6 * 100 = x600. After all, if multiplying by 10 means add one zero, it follows that multiplying by 100 means adding two zeroes.

6 * 10 * 100 * 1000 = x6000000 (pronounced 6 million). The pattern is to count up the zeroes and add them onto the end of the number. 

Another way of thinking about it is that the we shift the decimal to the xRIGHT.

What decimal?

The decimal on the 6.

But 6 doesn't have a decimal. 6 is just 6.

Every number secretly has a decimal point. 6 is the same as 6.0.

Which is the same as 6.00.

It's kind of like saying "I have 6 dollars" or "I have 6 dollars and 0 cents." The cents represents the decimals.

Basically, trailing decimal zeroes don't matter.

Can you have 10 trailing zeroes?

Like this? 6.0000000000000. Sure. It's the same as 6.

What about like this? 6.0001.

Nope. The idea of the trailing decimal zeroes means it MUST end with a zero. 6.0001 ends with a 1. 

Guys, does anyone else feel like suddenly, math is all about decimals and fractions?

@prev, Whole numbers are like apples. They are what everyone starts out with. 

Another name for whole numbers is "counting numbers."

Why is it called a counting number?

Because you can count it on your fingers.

Another name is integers.

But be careful! You don't have negative fingers. That means whole numbers have to be NOT NEGATIVE.

Integers on the other hand, can be positive or negative.

So 5 is a whole number.

5 is also an integer.

But -5 is not a whole number because it's negative.

But -5 is still an integer because integers can be positive or negative.

Is zero an integer?

Can you count zero fingers?

Sure, by not holding any fingers up.

That means yupsters. Zero is a whole number and also an integer.

In 1st grade, the focus is on criss-cross apple sauce.

In second grade, the focus is on addition and subtraction.

In third grade, the focus is on multiplication.

In fourth grade, the focus is on divison.

In fifth grade, the focus is on fractions and decimals.

In sixth grade, you start putting all of it together.

Which brings us to a new type of number: The rational number.

The rational number is the most frequent type of number to show up in 5th and 6th grade.

It comes from the word "ratio" which basically means "fraction."

Therefore, a rational number is essentially any number that can be written as a fraction.

2/7 is a rational number.

Certainly.

2/6 is a rational number.

Definitely.

2/2 is a rational number.

Absolutely.

Wait a second. Isn't 2/2 ... just 1? And isn't 1 ... a whole number?

Indeed it is @prev. Indeed it is. This might sound a little bit weird, but we just demonstrated that every whole number can actually also a rational number.

How can that be possible!

Because @prev, you can divide every single number by 1, and that will turn it into a fraction, which will turn it into a rational number. 

Even 0?

Yup. You can write 0/1 which equals 0 which is a fraction which therefore, is a rational number.

Even 99?

99 is the same as x99/1. It's a fraction. It's a rational number..

So then everything is a rational number!

Almost. There are 2 famous numbers that are considered irrational. Whenever you see "ir" infront of a word, it means NOT. Irrational means NOT rational which means you CAN'T write it as a fraction.

The first famous irrational number is pi, also known as 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884... on and on forever in a random pattern.

The second famous irrational number is e, also known as Euler's (his name is pronounced OILER) number, also known as 2.7182818284590452353602874713527... on and on forever in a random pattern.

You can write 1/3 as 0.333333333333333333 on and on forever. Why isn't 1/3 irrational?

The key is whether or not there is a pattern in the decimal. You can also write 1/7 forever like: 0.142857143142857143142857143... on and on forever, but just like 1/3, and just like 0.000000000, there is a repeating pattern in the decimal.

If there is a repeating decimal, you will be able to make a fraction out of it.

That is correct @prev. But for numbers like pi and e, there is no repeating decimal. There is no way to guess what the 1000th decimal, or the 1 millionth decimal will be. That's why they cannot be written as a fraction. 

Hence, that's why they are termed as irrational.

Are there any more irrational numbers besides pi and e?

There are lots more.

How many?

Infinite!

Infinite???? How is that possible? How will I memorize all of the irrational numbers? It will take me infinite years! It will take me infinite pieces of paper to write all of them down!

Don't worry @prev. The only 2 irrational numbers you need to memorize are pi and e. pi can be rounded to 3.14 and e can be rounded to 2.718. That's all you need.

But if you really want to, there is an award for anyone who can memorize the first 100 digits of pi. 

What kind of award?

In the official math teacher's rulebook, there is a rule that says, "Any student who can memorize and recite the first 100 digits of pi will receive a large apple pie."

Does that mean I can go to France, and recite the first 100 digits of pi to a French math teacher, and he or she will give me apple pie?

It most certainly does @prev. But you will have to recite it in French.

What if I go to Japan?

Yes. But you will have to recite it in Japanese.

Goodbye everyone. I will be going to Austria for some delicious Austrian apple pie!

Goodbye @prev, and have fun!

There is a HUGE point. Math is all about patterns. Currently the pattern is: Every time you multiply by 10, you shift a zero to the RIGHT.

If you multiply by 1000, you shift 3 zeroes to the right.

Exactly.

Any pattern you can do in one direction, 

Means you can do the pattern in the reverse direction.

Instead of multiplying by 10,

We can also divide by 10.

Instead of shifting to the RIGHT,

We would shift to the LEFT.

What is 6 div 10? The answer is x0.6. We shift LEFT once. #6 arr 0.6

What is 6 div 100? The answer is x0.06. We shift LEFT twice. #6 arr 0.06

What is 6 div 1000000 The answer is x0.000006. We shift LEFT 6 times.

Guys, I've noticed an interesting pattern. Look at each divisor, and look at each answer. The number of zeroes in the divisor tells you how many decimal places there are in the answer.

Holy smokes @prev! You're right. 10 has 1 zero. The answer has 1 decimal place. 1000000 has 6 zeroes. The answer has 6 decimal places.

Mrs. Ping and Mr. Ping loved making dumplings. For them, the answer was dumplings. But what was the question? Well, the question didn't matter. Because the answer to everything was delicious dumplings.

The first step is to make the dumpling wrapper. Mrs. Ping likes to use a ratio of 2 parts flour to 1 part water. Basically this means, if she uses 18 cups of flour, she will use x9 cups of water. No matter how much or how little you use, the ratio stays consistent.







"Mrs. Ping!" cried a young boy named Jayden as he ran, panting, to the Ping's front porch. "Jack is feeling sad."



"Why is Jack feeling sad?" asked Mr. Ping.

Becauses he asked Lisa if she wanted to grab a bubble tea on the way home from school.

And?

And Lisa said she can't.

Mr. Ping sat up in his arm chair. "Oh no!"

His mind flashed back to 60 years ago, when he was a young man. He had asked a young lady named Jing if she would like to get some sweet ginger tofu. Unfortunately, Jing had said no.

"Mrs. Ping, this is very important," said Mr. Ping urgently. "I know exactly how Jack feels."

"Jayden, where is Jack now?" asked Mrs. Ping.

"He's lying on the grass.

Mrs. Ping and Mr. Ping exchanged worried looks. Maomao was a very important cat. She protected the neighborhood from rats and spiders.

"I haven't seen her in 3 days," said Jayden.

"Mr. Ping!" said Mrs. Ping.

"Say no more Mrs. Ping. Say no more!"  Mr Ping had grabbed his walking stick and was already speed walking to Fei Long Supermarket. Every problem, has a solution. Every question, has an answer. 


But it doesn't make sense ... why the answer would be dumplings? Why is the answer dumplings lol.
It means next month, I won't be eating the soup.

gm ev1. This week is a special week.
It is the week of Mid-Autumn Festival.
Also known as the Mooncake Festival.
Also known as it's time to eat some mooncake.
Or frosted donuts with cream and jelly inside.
@prev, are you allowed to eat donuts for the Mooncake festival?
You can eat anything you like @prev.
Can we eat ice cream?
Of course.
Can we make the ice cream?
Don't you remember @prev? We tried making ice cream before, and didn't get very far. All we did was say that we would need a ratio of 2 parts cream to 1 part milk.
This time, we will get a little closer.
Because this time, we will add some sugar into our ratio as well.
How much sugar do we need @prev?
According to my research, the amount of sugar you add is half of how much milk you have.
So if we have 1 cup of milk, 
We will need half a cup of sugar.
We can rewrite the ratio as 2 parts cream to 1 part milk to 0.5 parts sugar.
Let's write an equivalent ratio, but this time, without any decimals. 
Are you allowed to do that?
You are! Ratios are basically another way of expressing fractions. Just like you can turn 1/2 into the equivalent fraction 2/4, you can perform a similar action with ratios.
For the ratio of 2 cream to 1 milk to 0.5 sugar, we can multiply everything by 2.
Now we have 4 parts cream to 2 parts milk to 1 part sugar. It's the same ratio. 
Is there a way to prove that it's the same ratio?
Yes @sir. We can turn the ratio into fraction. 4 parts cream, 2 parts milk, and 1 part sugar, if we add up all the parts, we will have 7 parts in total.
The fraction of cream will be 4/7 or 0.5714 as a decimal.
For milk, it will be 2/7 or 0.2857.
And for sugar, 1/7 or 0.1428.
Now let's do it for the original ratio: 2 parts cream, 1 part milk, 0.5 sugar.
The denominator will be to add up all the parts, giving us 3.5.
For cream, 2/3.5 is the same as 4/7.
Milk is 1/3.5 which is the same as 2/7.
And 0.5/3.5 is equivalent to 1/7. Just times the top and bottom by 2.
We have proved that the original ratio and new ratio.
Guys, does this basically mean ratios are just fractions?

Pretty much. Although, there are three types of questions that are extremely popular when doing ratios. 
The first type you've already seen. "Ms. Evangeline's potatoes can be cut into 80 slices for french fries. If Ms. Michelle has 5 of Evangeline's delicious potatoes, how many french fries can she make?"
This question is secretly a ratio question. The ratio is 1 potato to 80 fries. 5 potatoes means 400 fries.
In 6th grade and 7th grade, this type of question will get a little harder because ratios can combine together.
Combine together?
Like this: 1A = 2B and 4B = 10C and 10C = 15D and 60D = 10E. 4A equals how many E?

At its heart, although it looks much different, this question is exactly the same as potato to french fries, except with many more steps.

First, we turn the A's into B's.
1A = 2B. We have 4A. Following the ratio, 4A is equal to 8B.
Now turn the B's into C's.
Following the ratio of 4B to 10C, 8B will be 20C.
Continuing on, 20C will equal 30D.
For D and E, 60D = 10E.
But we don't have 60D.
We only have half.
So cut everything in half. 60D to 10E is the same as 30D to 5E. 
We have 30D.
The final answer we end up with 5E.

The second popular type of ratio question is called proportions. It goes something like this:

An ice cream recipe needs 2 cups of cream for every 1 cup of milk. How many cups of cream are needed if Ms. Elina uses 8 cups of milk?
You need twice as much cream as milk. So 16 cups of cream?
That's exactly correct @prev.


But usually, the question will have another step. You might have to convert cups to ounces.
How do you do that?
There are 8 ounces in 1 cup.
Since we have 16 cups of cream, would the answer be 8 * 16 = 128 ounces of cream?
That's perfect.

Everyone, this is great, but we still haven't made any ice cream.
But we added sugar!
We moved one inch closer!
After all, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Um @prev, how many inches are there in a mile?
The ratio of inches to feet is 1 to 12.
And the ratio of feet to miles is 5280 to 1.
Using these ratios, we can say that 1 mile equals 5280 * 12 = 63360 inches.
Since we have 1000 miles, multiply 63360 inches * 1000 to get 63360000 inches.
We've already taken one step!
That means we only have to take $display(63360000 - 1) more steps.
Great job everyone!

The word "part" often shows up when dealing with measurement ratios. Basically the idea is the "part" can be anything as long as the ratio is preserved. 
If you use 10 cups of cream, then you would want to use 5 cups of milk. 
If you use 18 cups of cream, you would need 9 cups of milk. 
For this example, the "part" refers to "cup."

Mrs. Ping's dumpling recipe says that one serving is 8 dumplings and that 2 cups of cream makes 1 serving.
We are going to make 160 dumplings in total.

How did you calculate that @prev?
It's because from 8 to 160, we multiply by 20. Which means we will need 20 servings. And since 1 serving is 20 cups of flour, we

Mooncakes and dumplings.

I already ate it. And then it ends. Food is truly life.  

To have something which others do not have. It is worth it. Cinco de Mayo. The food has to match the schedule. 

To pay homage to the holidays which appear. To consistently create a fun story to read. This is important to me.

They have trouble listening, but they have no trouble doing things on their own. Last class, I didn't ask for a single explanation and I didn't write anything on the board. Everything worked okay.


It's really hard to perfectly explain why 1 + 1 equals 2. Most of the time, math teachers will say something like, "well... 1 apple and 1 apple is 2 apples. That's why 1 + 1 equals 2." To perfectly explain why 1 + 1 equals 2 it's much more complicated than this. You can go to the library and checkout  a 300 page college math textbook called "Principia Mathematica." The whole book is about why 1 + 1 equals 2.

A lot of math is like this. Have you ever wondered why long division works? It's really hard to explain. Most of the time, teachers say something like, "just do it" or "follow the pattern."

We're now about to learn another one of these weird things. The big question is WHY does this work? Don't worry. Just do it. It will make sense later.

The rule is called KEEP-FLIP-MULTIPLY, or KFM.

Step 1. Keep the first fraction.
Step 2. Flip the second fraction.
Step 3. Multiply.

Keep-flip-multiply is used for dividing fractions.

What is 3/8 div 5/7?

Flip the second fraction. Instead of 5/7, we now have 7/5. 

Fun fact: Flipping a fraction is the same thing as "taking its reciprocal." (REE-SIHHH-PRIHH-COL) The reciprocal of 5/7 is 7/5 and the reciprocal of 7/5 is 5/7.

Finally we multiply.

3/8 * 7/5 = 21/40.

So the answer to 3/8 div 5/7 is 21/40.

What is 9/2 div 9/2? 

1. Keep the first fraction.
2. Flip the second fraction.
3. Multiply

9/2 * 2/9 = 18/18 = 1

This answer of 1 should make sense because a very important rule is that ANYTHING div ANYTHING, if it is the SAME thing, will always equal 1. 6 div 6 = 1. 923 div 923 = 1. xdiv x = 1. y div y = 1. Therefore, of course 9/2 div 9/2 will also have to equal 1.

09-21-2021 Review Notes

factors The ways to make 9 are 1 * 9 and 3 * 3. That means the factors for 9 are 1, 3, and 9. For 22, the possibilities are 1 * 22 and 2 * 11. That means the factors for 22 are 1, 2, 11, 22. How many factors do 9 and 22 have in common? They only have ONE factor in common: the number 1.

prime-factors How many prime factors do 9 and 22 have in common? The only factors 9 and 22 share are 1. But 1 is not a prime number. Therefore, they have ZERO prime factors in common.

decimal-multiplication What does 0.06 times 5 equal? 3 decimals on 0.011 means shift LEFT 3 times. 2 extra zeroes on the 1300 means shift RIGHT 2 times. That means the final answer, will shift LEFT once. 5 * 6 = 30. After shiffint left once, the answer is 0.3.

lowest-common-multiple What is the smallest common multiple of 3 and 7? Because these numbers are small, you can list it out. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 ... for 3. And, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 ... for 7. The smallest common multiple occurs at 21. The answer is 21.

unique The word "unique" and "distinct" means "different". The sum of the unique factors of 8 will be to get all the factors of 8 that are different from each other (1, 2, 4, 8) and then add them up.

percents 20% of 30 = ? "of" means multiply. "%" means "percentage" which means divide by 100 which means shift the decimal to the left twice. We can rewrite the question as 0.2 * 30. The answer is 6.

percents 20% of 20% of 20% of 20 = 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 20 = 32 with ONE right-shift and FOUR left-shifts to give a final answer of 0.032.

percents 20% more than 30 = ? First find 20% of 30 which is 6. (See previous question) Since we want more than, add this number onto the 30.

ratios-with-percents 40% of Aaron's tangerine dance class is boys. The rest are girls. What is the ratio of girls to boys? 40% means 4 out of 10. That means the ratio will be 4 to 6 for boys to girls, which means the ratio of girls to boys will be 6 to 4.

prime-factorization It means break a number down into ONLY prime factors. The prime factorization of 8 is 2 * 2 * 2. You can't do 4 * 2 because 4 is not a prime number.

conversions How many hours in 1 minute? 60 minutes is 1 hour. 59 minutes is 59/60 hours. 58 minutes is 58/60 hours. So in one minute, we have 1/60 hours. As a decimal: 0.166 hours.

You never know. Like a 1% chance. 
More like a 0.01% chance.
Can percentages have decimals?
Of course @prev. Anything that is a number can have a decimal point.

That means there's a chance.
Probability is the math word for "chance."
@next, what is the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads?
Since the possible choices are heads or tails, that means there are 2 choices for the denominator.
Also known as the fraction 1/2.
also known as the percentage 50%.
Also known as the decimal 0.5.
Also known as the ratio 1:1.

For probability, you never write it as a ratio. 
The most popular way to write it is as a percentage or as a fraction.
Can I write the probability as a mixed number?
It can never be a mixed number.
A mixed number is something like 1 and 1/2. Or 2 and 2/3. Which would be equal to 150%.
For probability, it doesn't make sense to have anything over 100% because the biggest chance of something happening is 100%.
Can you have negative probabilities?

Just like how 100% is the highest chance (meaning it will definitely happen), the lowest chance will be 0%, meaning it will not happen. For this reason, the answer is NO. You cannot have negative probabilities.
Basically, a probability is a percentage from 0 to 100. Nothing higher, and nothing lower.

What's the problem of rolling an even number when you roll a 6-sided dice?

A 6-sided dice has the numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6 on each of its faces. 
3 of the numbers are even.
And there are 6 choices possible.
The fraction is 3/6.
Which can be simplified into 1/2.
The probability is 1/2 or 50% or 0.5.

What's the probability of rolling a prime number?

09-26-2021 Multiplying with zeros and decimals

Step 1. Ignore the zeros and decimals and do the simple multiplication.
Step 2. Put the zeroes and decimals back in.

If you have 5 zeros, that means you shift RIGHT 5 times.   (3400000)
if you have 3 decimals, that means you shift LEFT 3 times. (0.123)

Example 1: 0.9 * 0.009 

First do 9 * 9 = 81
Second, in total, there are 4 decimal places. Shift LEFT 4 times.

Start: 81
Shift 1: 8.1
Shift 2: 0.81
Shift 3: 0.081
Shift 4: 0.0081 

Example 2: 0.9 * 600

First do 9 * 6 = 54
Second, there are 2 extra zeros. Shift RIGHT twice. There is 1 decimal place. Shift LEFT once.

Start: 54
Shift right 1: 540
Shift right 2: 5400
Shift left 1: 540

Example 3: 0.01 * 0.2 * 3000

First, do 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
Second, There are 3 extra zeroes. Shift RIGHT 3 times. There are 3 decimal places in total. Shift LEFT 3 times. 

Start: 6
Shift right 1: 60
Shift right 2: 600
Shift right 3: 6000
Shift left 1: 600
Shift left 2: 60
Shift left 3: 6

Tip: If you have the same number of extra zeros and decimals, they will cancel each other out.

09-30-2021 !Removing Decimals from Fractions

Example 1: 1/0.1 has a decimal place in the bottom. Multiply the top and bottom by 10 because there is 1 decimal place.

Example 2: 0.23/0.00000009

There are 8 decimal places in the denominator. There are 2 decimal places in the numerator. The winner is 8. Multiply the top and bottom with 8 zeroes. 

8 zeroes means "times 100,000,000".

The denominator's 8 decimal places will cancel with the 8 zeroes. We will be left with the number 9.

For the numerator, if we are multiplying by 8 zeroes, that means we shift RIGHT 8 times.

Current: 0.23
1 shift: 2.3  
2 shift: 23
3 shift: 230
4 shift: 2300
5 shift: 23000
6 shift: 230000
7 shift: 2300000
8 shift: 23000000

The answer is 23000000/9.

09-26-2021 Factors of a number

The factors of 6 are 1, 6, 2, 3 because 1 * 6 = 6 and 2 * 3 = 6.
The factors of 7 are 1, 7 because 1 * 7.

Write down the numbers from 1 to 100 that only have 2 factors.


A prime number is a number that only has two factors. The two factors cannot be the same number.
How many prime numbers are there from 1 to 100?


"sum" means add it up.
"distinct" means "unique" or "different"
"integers" means positive or negative whole numbers. They can be represented as "x", "y", "z" or "a", "b", "c" or any letter that you like.

english: The sum of 5, 6, and one-fourth of 3 more than x is 5 more than the sum of 3 distinct integers.
translation: 5 + 6 + (1/4 * (x + 3)) = (a + b + c) + 5



10-16-2021 dialogue notes Translating from English to Math Expressions

5 minus 3 is x. We can translate this english phrase into the math expression: 5 - 3 = x.

5 less than 3 is x. This can be translated into "3 - 5 = x." It's reversed.

5 plus 3 is x.
5 + 3 = x.

5 more than 3 is x.
3 + 5 = x.
Again, it's reversed. The pattern is anytime the sentence has a "than" in it, you kind of write it backwards. "Backwards" means the number you say first, goes after the second number, instead of going before it.

Notes:
"Of" means multiply. (6 * 3)
"Product" means multiply. (6 * 3)
"Times" means multiply. (6 * 3)
"Is" means equals.
"Sum" means add it all up. (2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
"Difference" means subtract. (6 - 3)
"Fraction" means divide. (6 / 3)
"Ratio" (pronounced RAY-SHE-O) means divide. (6 / 3)
"Quotient" (pronounced KWO-SHENT) means divide. (6 / 3)
'%" (pronounced percent) can just be written as '%'. You can also write it as "/100." For example, 35% can be written as 35%. Or, it can be written as 35/100.


The english sentence is: The sum of 20% of x and 5 more than y is z.
The math translation is: (20% * x) + (y + 5) = z


The english sentence is: One-third of one-sixth of one-ninth of x is 10% of 50.
The math translation is: 1/3 * 1/6 * 1/9 * x = 10% * 50

10% more than 5 is x.
First, 10% more than 5 means: 5 + (10% * 5). 
Second, put it together: 5 + (10% * 5) = x


10% less than 5 is x.
First, 10% less than 5 means: 5 - (10% * 5)
Second, Put it together: 5 - (10% * 5) = x

10% less than x is 10% more than y.
First, 10% less than x means: x - (10% * x)
Second, 10% more than y means: y + (10% * y)
Finally, put it together: x - (10% * x) = y + (10% * y)

a% of b is c% more than d
First, a% of b means: a% * b
Second, c% more than d means: d + (c% * d)
Lastly, put it together: a% * b = d + (c% * d)


One-third times more than two-fifth of 20 is 3 times as much as x.
This one has a few things going on. Let's start backwards. 
1. 3 times as much as x. That means 3 * x or 3x.
2. 2/5 of 20. That's just 2/5 * 20.
3. 1/3 times more than the stuff that we just did. The stuff that we just did is (2/5 * 20). 1/3 times more than it means we multiply it by 1/3, and add it on to the original. That means: (2/5 * 20) + ((2/5 * 20) * 1/3).
4. Finally, set it equal to each other. The final answer is (2/5 * 20) + ((2/5 * 20) * 1/3).


Tips for solving for x: When the equation is 2x - 3 = 5, first move the 3 to the other side. Next, to get x by itself, divide by 2. What if instead your equation is x/2 - 3 = 5?
First, do the exact same thing. Move the 3 to the other side. Now we to get rid of "divided by 2." When the equation was "2x", which is the same thing as "2 * x" or "2 times x", the way we "undo" the times 2 is dividing by 2. 
This time we want to "undo" or "cancel out" the divided by 2. So we multiply by 2. The basic summary is, do the opposite. To undo addition, do subtraction. To undo subtraction, do addition. To undo multiplication, do division, and to undo division, do multiplication.

Good morning everyone. To divide fractions just remember KFC.

Kentucky Fried Chicken?

Yes @prev. That is the secret to dividing fractions.

@back This is the most important thing I've learned all month!

Wait until you learn this: KFC's new signature sandwich is a mouth-watering premium double-breaded extra crispy chicken breast filet. It's exquisite!

Um... To solve 3/4 div 7/9 =

First, take a bite of your KEEP-FLIP-CHANGE crispy chicken sandwich, and say, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. Delicious!"

Secondly, after you've kept the first fraction by doing nothing to it, flip the second fraction, and change the divide sign to a multiply sign. Now multiply the fractions together.

Thirdly, keep eating your sandwich. You're done!

Woot woot!

Important Tip 1: Sometimes the fraction, might not be a fraction. It might be something like "3" or "x" or z" or "7". You can just turn it into a fraction by dividing by 1. For example, 3 = 3/1.

Important Tip 2: You don't always have to multiply everything out. If there is a 234 on the top and a 234 on the bottom, they will just cancel out because 234/234 = 1.

Importrant Tip 3: When there are multiple fractions, like 2/3 div 3/4 div 4/5, do it one piece at a time. First do 2/3 div 3/4. After you get the answer, do the answer div 4/5.

Important Tip 4: Sometimes, if the question doesn't have any numbers in it, you might get an answer like (a * a) / (b * b). This is correct. You can also write it with exponents: a^2 / b^2. Both ways of writing it are correct.

Important Tip 5: Don't forget to simplify. If the answer is (a * a) / a, you can simplify the answer to a because 1 pair of the a's will cancel out. If the answer is (a * a * b * b) / (a * a * b * b), you can simply the answer to 1 because everything will cancel out.

10-07-2021 notes

What do you see when you see when you look at the number 20%? I see 20%. I also, at the same time, see 0.2. I also see 20/100. I also see 1/5. It is useful to see a thing multiple ways when doing math. When I look at the number 8, of course, I see the number 8. But at the same time, I see 2 * 2 * 2, and I also see 2^3. 

When I see the number 5, I also see 2 + 3 and 1 + 4. When I look at 5x, I see 1x + 4x and 2x + 3x. After many many years of teaching math, of doing the same thing over and over, I have just started to see these things.

When I see the number 1024, I instantly see 2 times itself 10 times, also known as 2^10. Is it because I am a super big brain math person? Of course not. Teach something 20 times. I bet you will remember it too. 

Sometimes I look at a student's homework, and it takes me 1 second to know if the answer is right or wrong. Is it because I am a super big brain math guy? Of course not. It is because I see the patterns. When you do something over and over again, you will always see the patterns.

The question might be something like 28349 * x * 23123 = 238019238102 and the student writes x = 0. Well I don't even need to think about it. There's no way x is zero because anything times zero equals zero and the right side of the equation is certainly not zero.

Or the question is something like 23423 * 287 = ? And the student writes 438232. But I just know that can't be the answer. The first digit of 23423 is 3 and the first digit of 287 is 7. 3 * 7 is 21. That means the first digit of the answer has to start with a 1.

Students like to spend their time on:

"This question is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo easy."
"Is Bob better than me??? Is me better than Bob???????? Ahhhhhhhh~~~~~~"
"Me got the answer right. That means I'm big brain oh yeah oh yeah!"
"Me can't do the question. That means I'm not big brain. Merp merp."

My recommendation:

Also spend some time collecting math patterns.
The more math patterns you have in your brain, the faster you will see the answer. 


10-07-2021 Formulas

D = RT is a well-known formula that says: Distance = Rate * Time. 

Rate means how fast you're doing something. A turtle has a pretty slow movement rate. A sports car has a super fast movement rate. A shorter of way of saying movement rate, is to say "speed" or "velocity." We will use the word speed.

When you are given a formula, the goal is to solve for the missing variable.





At Kaylee's donut farm, she picks 20 donuts from the donut tree every minute. How many donuts does Kaylee pick in 10 minutes?

You might look at this question and say, "Can we use D = RT? Where's the distance?" For this question, you can think of the total number of donuts picked as being the distance.

There is another version of D = RT called A = RT where A stands for "total amount." However, because most of these questions always talk about distance, the popular version is to use D = RT.

20 apples per minute is the rate
10 minutes is the time
Plug these numbers into the equation: D = 10 * 20. 
Solve for the final variable D. 
The answer is 200.

At Elina's icecream factory, she makes 50 icecreams every hour. In one day, her factory makes 400 icecreams. How many hours was Elina's factory open?

50 icecreams per hour is the rate
Total amount of icecreams is 400
Plug these numbers into the equation: 400 = 50 * T
The missing variable is T. The answer is T = 8 hours.

Vroom vroom! Vroom vroom! Lynn is bicycling around town for 3 hours. She travels a distance of 6 miles. What is her bicycling speed in miles per hour?

Time is 3 hours

10-07-2021 Number Ranges #sequencePreIntroduction

How many numbers are there from 1 to 10
First, subtract the endpoints. 10 - 1 = 9.
Second, add 1. 
The answer is 9 + 1 = 10.
Check your answer by counting on your fingers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 is indeed 10 numbers.

An even number is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and so on. An odd number is 1, 3, 5, 7, et cetera. Basically, if you can divide a number by 2 without a remainder or a decimal, then it's going to be an even number.

How many even numbers are there from 1 to 10?
First, count up the numbers. There are 10 numbers.
Now, divide it in two because even and odd are split in half.
The answer is 5 even numbers from 1 to 10.

How many even numbers are there from 5 to 13?
(13 - 5) + 1 = 9.
Cut 9 in half and we get 4.5.
Look at the starting number. Is it even? Then the answer will be 4.5 rounded up.
Our starting number is odd. We round our answer down.
Final answer: There are 4 even numbers from 5 to 13.
Proof: 5, [6], 7, [8], 9, [10], 11, [12], 13

The word "inclusive" means you include the endpoints.
How many numbers are there from 1 to 10?
There are 10 numbers.
How many numbers are there from 1 to 10 inclusive?
There are 10 numbers.
The word inclusive doesn't really change anything.

The word "exclusive" means you exclude the endpoints.
How many numbers are there from 1 to 10?
There are 10 numbers.
How many numbers are there from 1 to 10 exclusive?
You have to exclude the endpoints. 
The final answer is 10 - 2 = 8 numbers.
Proof: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 is 8 numbers in total.

10-07-2021 Algebraic I - Distribution 
6 * (3 + 2) = ?
First we do, 3 + 2 which is 5. The answer is 5 * 6 equals 30.
There is another way we can do this problem: Also known as distribution.

The word "distribute" means "to share."

Share the 6 with the 3.
6 * 3 = 18

Now share the 6 with the 2.
6 * 2 = 12.

Now add it up.
12 + 18 = 30. (We get the same answer)

a * (b + c) = ?

First, share the a with the b.
a * b = ab

Now share the a with the c.
a * c = ac

The final answer is a * (b + c) = ab + ac

2(3 + 5) = ?

Sometimes, there is no multiplication sign between a number and a parentheses. That means there is an invisible multiplication sign.

The answer is (2 * 3) + (2 * 5) = 6 + 10 = 16

For this question, 2(3 + 5), distribution isn't necessary. You can just do 3 + 5 and then multiply that by 2. The power of distribution shows up when you need to solve for x.

2(x + 3) = 10

Step 1: Distribute.
2(x + 3) = 2x + 6

2x + 6 = 10
Subtract the 6 to the other side.
And then divide by 2.
Answer: x = 2

Find x: 2(x + 1) + 3(x + 2) + 4(x + 5) = 37

Flatten everything out by distributing.
2x + 2 + 3x + 6 + 4x + 20 = 37
Combine the x's together. Combine the normal numbers together.
9x + 28 = 37
Subtract the 28 to the other side.
And then divide by 9.
Answer: x = 1

Every week you need to learn something new.
Something that pushes the boundary forward.


Combine the x's together.


10-07-2021 Algebraic II - Adding and subtracting 1

283 - 234 can be made much simpler if we add 1, and then subtract 1.
Adding 1, and then subtracting 1, is the same as adding 0 which you are allowed to do.
283 + 1 - 234 - 1 = ?
284 - 234 = 50
50 - 1 = 49

We can do this type of algebraic manipulation for multiplication too.

199 * 3 = ... let's change 199 by adding 1, and subtracting 1.

(199 + 1 - 1) * 3 = 
(200 - 1) * 3

200 * 3 = 600
1 * 3 = 3

600 - 3 = 597. 

Student says: "I think doing it like this is dumb. It's much easier to just do it the normal way."
Teacher response: "Do it this way for this assignment."

You must show your work for this assignment.

10-08-2021 review

solving-for-x For expressions that have lots of parts, like "3x - 2 + 6 + 4 = 4x + 2", combine the x's together, and combine the numbers together. This will simplify the above expression into 3x + 8 = 4x + 2.

solving-for-x When you have x's on both sides of the equation, put the x's all on one side, and put all of the numbers onto the other side. 3x + 8 = 4x - 2. Move the 2 to the left side by adding 2. Move the 3x to the right side by subtracting 3x. We now end up with 10 = 1x. x equals 10.

ratios 1 hour = 3600 seconds. How many hours are in one second? Look. 1 hour. Is. 3600 seconds. But we only want it for one second. So take the 3600, and divide it by 3600 because 3600/3600 = 1. But you can't just divide one side. If we divide the right side by 3600, that means we have to divide the left side by 3600 too. The left side is "1 hour." Divide it by 3600 and we get "1/3600 hours".

prime a number is prime if ONLY two different numbers can multiply to make it. 1 is not prime because 1 * 1. We need two different numbers, but 1 and 1 are the same number. 6 is not prime because 1 * 6 and 2 * 3 gives us 4 possible numbers. A prime number can only have 2. 7 is a prime number because only 1 * 7 equals 7. There are no other possibilities.

When solving for x, there are a few common strategies. The most useful strategy is put all the x's on one side, and put all the numbers onto the other side. But there are other useful strategies too. One of these strategies is: "Try to get rid of decimals and fractions."

Consider this equation: 2x + 0.1 = 0.5x.

It's not very fun because there are decimals. Let's multiply everything by 10.


left-side:
2x * 10 is 20x.
0.1 * 10 is 1.

Right-side:
0.5x * 10 is 5.

We are allowed to do this because we did it to everything. We did it to the left side. We did it to the right side. Essentially, just like you can multiply a fraction by 10 on top and 10 on bottom to create an equivalent fraction, you can create an equivalent equation in the exact same way.

Our new equation is 20x + 1 = 5. This is so much nicer!

How did I know to multiply by everything by 10? It's because I looked at all the decimals and saw that the biggest decimal place is 1 decimal place.

2x - 0.0001 = 0.5x

For this equation, the biggest decimal place is no longer 1 place decimal place. It's 4 decimal places. To cancel this out, I will need 4 extra zeroes, which means I will multiply everything by 10000.

2x * 10000 is 20000x.
0.0001 * 10000 cancels to 1.
0.5x * 10000 is 1 left-shift and 4 right-shifts to give 5000x.

The equivalent equation is: 20000x - 1 = 5000x. 

Move 5000x to the left side.
Move 1 to the right side.
The final answer is x = 1/15000


Let's do the same thing, this time with fractional equation. Kepp in mind the goal: Remove decimals and remove fractions by changing the equation into an equivalent "nicer" equation.

2x/3 = 6

The left side has a denominator of 3. That is the same thing as saying, "currently, the left side is being divided by 3." How do you cancel out divided by 3? You multiply by 3. Let's multiply the entire equation by 3.

left-side: 2x/3 * 3 cancels to just 2x.
Right-side: 6 * 3 = 18.

The equivalent equation is 2x = 18. Much nicer!

(2x - 3 + 2x - 9 + a - c)/3 = 6

Scary scary. But you just do the same thing. The equivalent equation is 2x - 9 + a - b = 18.

"Omg!!! What is that "a"? What is that "b"? Don't worry. The question will probably say something like, "a is 4" or "b is half of 10."

2x/3 = x - 4

The denominator is 3 so that is the target that we will try to cancel out. On the left side, after multiplying by 3, it will just be 2x. On the right side, x * 3 is 3x, and 4 * 3 is 12.

The equivalent equation is 2x = 3x - 12

(2x + 1)/3 = (3x - 2)/4

This time, both sides of the equation have a denominator. You will do the exact same thing ... you just do it twice, one for each side.

First we get rid of divided by 3. That means multiply by 3 on both sides.

Left side is now: (2x + 1)
Right side is now: 3 * (3x - 2) / 4

Now we get rid of the divided by 4. That means multiply by 4 on both sides.

Left side is now: 4 * (2x + 1)
Right side is now: 3 * (3x - 2) 

Expand the left side: (expand just means to multiply it out)
4 * 2x = 8x
4 * 1 = 4

The left side is: 8x + 4

Expand the right side: 
3 * 3x = 9x
3 * 2 = 6

The right side is 9x - 6

Finally, the equivalent expression is 8x + 4 = 9x - 6.
Put the x's on one side, and put the numbers on the other side.
We will end up with 10 = 1x.
x = 10

That was a lot. Do you think you can do a question on your own? I bet you can. I bet if someone gave you 30 minutes and some math notes and 3 slices of delicious apple pie, you could definitely do the problem: (2x + 3)/2 = (5x - 6)/5



The feelings will coalesece. 



For a very long time now, we have been solving for x. 2x + 6 = 10. 2x/3 = 3x - 2. Et cetera et cetera. These questions are called one-variable equations because there is only one variable: "x."

But it doesn't have to be one variable. We can solve two-variable equations too.

x + y = 4
x - y = 2

Find x and find y.

Guess a number for x. I guess ... 10. But then no number works for y.
Guess a number for x. I guess ... 9. But then no number works for y.
Guess a number for x. I guess ... 8. But then no number works for y.

Eventually, you will find two numbers that works for both x and y in both equations. That will be the answer.


Do you know what's even more fun than two-variable equations?

Yes! Yes you guessed it! Three-variable equations.

x + y + z = 6
x - 2y = 4
z + x = 3

At first it looks impossible, but you have all the tools that you need to solve it. 

We have learned a lot of techniques for solving for x.

Substitution is the most

To find the 100th decimal value of 1/7 (pronounced 1 over 7), begin with long division. 
@pdflongdivision(1/7)

That's very good. Now keep going. We have to find the 100th decimal. There are 90 more decimals to go.

We don't have to keep going. There's a pattern.

10-14-2021 essay Variable Word Problem Questions

Example 1: X candies cost Y dollars. How much do Z candies cost?

This type of question is called a "pure variable question" because there are no numbers. Instead, all of the numbers have been replaced with variables.

A helpful strategy when approaching questions like these is to make up some numbers for yourself. Don't make up weird numbers like 23 or 1.443. Choose nice numbers like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 20, 60.

Let's rewrite the question as: 2 candies cost 10 dollars. How much do 6 candies cost?

If 2 costs 10, the pattern is times 5. So 6 will cost 6 * 5 = 30 dollars.

Now, turn all of the numbers back into their original variables. 

X = 2
Y = 10
Z = 6

And we know that using these numbers, the answer that we're going to get is 30.
There's only one way to make 30 with these numbers: 6 * 10 / 2.

The final answer is Z * Y / X.

Example 2: X candies cost 10 dollars. How much do 5 candies cost?

This is called a "mixed-variable question" because there are both variables and numbers. You should do it the exact same way, except this time, the question has already made up a few of the numbers for you. 

Let's make up a number for X. I will choose the number 1.

The question is now: 1 candy costs 10 dollars. How much do 5 candies cost? 
Answer: 50 dollars.

Write out the variables:
X = 1
10 = 10
5 = 5

How can we make the number 50? There are two options:

10 * 5 * 1
10 * 5 / 1

This is not good. There are two ways of doing it. Which one is the correct way? Don't know. That means, it was a mistake to choose the number 1. I will do it again, and choose a different number: 2. 

The question is now: 2 candies costs 10 dollars. How much do 5 candies cost? 

If 2 candies cost 10 dollars, 1 candy costs 5 dollars, which means 5 candies cost 25 dollars.
Answer: 25 dollars

Our numbers:

X = 2
10 = 10
5 = 5

This time it works. There is only one way to make 25: 5 * 10 / 2
Putting the variables back in, the answer is: 5 * 10 / X.
Simplify, and the final answer is 50/X.

"...But I don't know what X is. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"

That's fine. For these types of variable questions, this is just how it goes. The answer will almost always have a variable in it. The only time the answer will not have a variable is if the variable cancels out. For example, a final answer like 50X/X. The X's will cancel, and the answer will just be 50.

Closing Points:

The variables we used in these examples were X,Y, and Z. But it doesn't have to be these letters. The question can use any letter from A to Z. Instead of letters, they might even use weird symbols like "emoji.alpha" or "emoji.beta". Also, instead of candies as we used in these examples, it might instead be Lynn's delicious homemade granola bars. No matter what they use, no matter how delicious Lynn's homemade granola bars are, the strategies you use for solving these questions, remains the same.

I often feel reluctant to give parents "good news."

Reason: They get overhyped, and start having high expectations. Their kid underperforms.

I often feel reluctant to give parents "bad news."

Reason: They start thinking their kid is going to fail and not get into college and work at Walmart. They start putting pressure on the kid to change or improve. Their kid performs worse.

The end result: I don't give parents any news.

But obviously this is incorrect. The parents want to know what's going on.

How do I give information that parents want to hear, while at the same time, not creating any expectations, or creating any fears?

Dividing whole numbers always makes the original number smaller. For example, 8 div 2 = 4. The 8 has become smaller. But for fractions, this is not always true. For example, 1/2 div 1/50 = 25. How did that happen! We divided a fraction, by a smaller fraction, and somehow ended up with a much bigger whole number???

One way to understand it is to turn your fractions into decimals.

1/2 becomes 0.5
1/50 becomes 0.02

Now let's turn the decimals into money.

0.5 is 0.5 dollars is 50 cents.
0.02 is 0.02 dollars is 2 cents.

2 cents goes into 50 cents 25 times.
That's how we ended up with the answer of 25.

10-18-2021 dialogue mathfacts doagain
a gm ev1
ev gm Aaron1
a today we’re going to learn some math facts.
kl I’ll go first. The first math fact is for comparing numbers with greater than or less than, the bigger number always points at the smaller number.
kay, Elina which statement is correct: /5gt3 or /5lt3qm
e The answer is /5gt3
a Great job Elina. The bigger number is the one that points. Follow the direction of the arrow. 5 is indeed greater than 3.

“greater than” and “less than” are also accompanied by “greater than or equal to” and “less than or equal to.”

pmwb fe/for example
fe, /5gt5 is not true because 5 is not greater than 5, but /5gte5 is true because is greater than or equal to 5.

mf2; to find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the base by the height.
can I multiply by the length instead of the baseqm
of course you can. the base and the length mean the same thing. but do keep in mind, math books usually write the formula as /area=bth.
i’m special. i want to multiply by the length times the width instead of the base times the height. is that okayqm
el, you can multiply by whatever you want. just remember that it’s always going to be x times y.
what’s x and what’s y?

x is the hoooooooooorizontal distance. hooooooorizontal is looooooong like a hotdog.
y is the vertical distance. vertical starts with the letter V which looks like a tall mountain. Also, y is taller than x.

x is up for left to right. 
y is for up and down.
that means you can write the area of a rectangle as /bth or /xty or /ltw.

mf3. to find the perimeter of a rectangle, all you have to do is add up all of the sides.

hey el, what’s the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of 4, 5, 6, 7qm
that’s an impossible question el1 the opposite sides of a rectangle are always equal1 take a look at these rectangles.
that’s correct1 gj el1

what’s the perimeter of a rectangle where 1 side is twice the other side and the area is 8qm

hummzles. well area means base times height. it’s time to start guessing a few numbers.
i like to start my guess with a easy number to keep things simple.
how about we guess the number 1qm
and since the other side has to be twice as long, the other side is going to be 2.
1 times 2 equals 2.
but we want 8!
let’s try the number 2 this time.
that means the other side is 4.
2 times 4 is 8!
Woot woot! we did it1
everybody. pull out a permanent marker and mark. your. answer1 the answer is 8!
/i el reaches for her permanent marker and is about to circle “8.” el2 swats the marker away.
what are you doing el2qm i was about to mark my answer.
i was saving you said el. the question doesnt want 
it’s okay el

mf4. a square is a special type of rectangle where all the sides are equal.

mf5 % means divide by 100.
I thought % means percents?
They are. But you can also think of percents as a special type of fraction where the denominator has to be 100. 
Does that mean I can write something like 1%%%?
Sure. It would simply mean 1 divided by 100, divided by 100, divided by 100.
mf6 ! means factorial.
What’s a factorial?
I thought ! means exclamation mark. Like, “I just ate a pork dumpling. Oh yeah!”
In math, “!” is called factorial. It’s kind of hard to explain what it means. You just have to see it.
Show me!
3! = 3t2t1 and 4! = 4t3t2t1
5! equals 5t4t3t2t1?
Yup. 
Just like with percents, you can stack factorials together. You can do something like 3!!
mf7. 0! equals
Zero! Guys, this exclamation mark is not a factorial, it’s my excitement.
im terribly sorry, el but it’s not zero.
What? But look at the pattern
3! = 3t2t1
2! = 2t1
1! = 1
0! = 0
it has to be zero.
That’s what it certainly seems like, but for now just memorize. 0! equals 1. In high school, you will go through a proof which proves why it is. 
okay. next math fact. number: 1 is not a prime number. 1 only has one unique factor. A prime number will always have two unique factors.
mf9 the word “distinct”, “unique”, and “different” all mean the same thing.
kay um Kloe. This isn’t english class. Why are we learning vocabulary words?
kloe because sometimes, the question will use these words to try and confuse you.
Also, questions will sometimes add on the words “whole number, positive, or integer.”
The question could ask you, “What are the factors of 6?”
But instead, to make the question seem harder, they will ask, “What are the positive integer factors of 6?” Don’t be thrown off by the extra words. The question is just asking for the factors of 6.
kloe Another thing to be careful about when doing factor questions is to remember that 1 is a factor. Lots of times, students will write 2, 3, and 6 are the factors of 6, without writing the 1.
mf10 consecutive means “in a row”, like 1, 2, 3, 4.
And consecutive odd means “in a row” but only odd numbers.
And consecutive even means “8, 10, 12, 14, et cetera.”
mf11 an integer is a number that doesn’t have a decimal.
so an integer is a whole numberqm
yup yup
mf12 a rational number is any number which can be written as fraction.
so f2/3 is a fraction.
and f 1/100 is a rational number.
and 3 is a rational number.
I thought 3 is a whole number. 
Sometimes whole numbers can be rational numbers.
How?
You can write 3 as 3/1. 
So a whole number is always going to be rational number too?. 
Yup yup.
You can say 100 is a whole number and a rational number because 100/1 = 100?
Yup yup!
mf13 A never ending decimal without a pattern is called an irrational number.
⅓ equals 0.33333 which is a never-ending decimal. 
But the decimal has a pattern. You can predict what will come next. It’s going to be all threes. Therefore, it is NOT irrational. 
What about 1/7?
1/7 written as a decimal is 0.142857142857. It has a pattern of 142857.
So what’s an irrational number then? 
fpi is irrational. pi is a number that often shows up in circle geometry. Usually, we just use the number 3.14, but if you want write it all the way out, pi = 3.1415926535 8979323846 2643383279 5028841971 6939937510 5820974944 5923078164 0628620899 8628034825 3421170679 and on and on forever. 


Are there any other irrational numbers?
Yup. The square-root of 2. Like Pi, it goes on forever. 
What does it look like?
It looks like this.
sqrt2 = 1.4142135623730950488016887242096980785696718753769480731766797379907324784621

What’s a square root?
I’m so glad you asked Elina! That’s our next math fact.

by the way, can I ask a question real quick?
Of course Aaron. It’s your life. 
It's my life! ~
It's now or never ~
Guys what are we singing!
But I ain't gonna live forever ~
I just want to live while I'm alive ~
“It’s My Life,” by Bon Jovi.
So my question is, earlier we saw that a number can be a whole number and a rational number at the same time. Can a number be a rational number and an irrational number at the same time?
That’s a great question Aaron. The answer is no. It is mutually exclusive. Either you are rational, or you are irrational. You cannot be both.

One way to remember is to know that the prefix “ir” means NOT. For instance, irregular means NOT regular. Irreversible means NOT reversible. Irrational means NOT rational.

Now back to square roots.
Do we have to? Can we take a break instead?
But I want to tell you what a square root is!
Fine…
A square root is when you’re planting a carrot. 

6pxgt3. wvcxnb

Great job everyone!



What does mutually exclusive mean?
It’s a phrase in math that means “can’t both happen at the same time.” For example, being a girl or a boy is mutually exclusive. You cannot be both at the same time. 



It’s when you go backwards from a square. 3 squared equals 9. Therefore, going backwards, the square root of 9 is 3.
Why are you so big brain Aaron?
I’m not. I’m just me.
Then how do you know what a square root is?
Because I’m reading it from a piece of paper.

After growing 16,000 potatoes, msevang realizes she has way too many potatoes. After all, who needs 16,000 potatoes? She decides to give away all of her potatoes except for 1000 of them. "Everybody can have a bag of 5 potatoes!" How many people will be able to get some of evang's potatoes?

msemily was one of the lucky people to get some of Evangeline's potatoes. "Oh boy. time to eat some potato soup tonight," says emily. her recipe says, "For every potato, you will need 3 carrots, 1 onion, and 1 green pepper." She decides to use all 5 potatoes for her potato soup. In total, how many carrots, onions, and green peppers will emily need?

msmch was also one of the lucky people to receve a bag of msevang's potatoes. Rather than make potato soup like emily, mch decides to make french fries. evang's potatoes aren't normal potatoes. they're jumbo-sized. that means each potato can be chopped into 60 french fries. However, mch messes up on one of the potatoes and only chops 55 strips instead of 60 strips. how many french fries does mch end up makingqmm

mr daniel wanted to wake up early to get in line for some of evang's potatoes. he set his alarm clock for 6:30AM. Unfortunately, he overslept and woke up at 7:37AM. by how many minutes did mr daniel oversleep?

to make sure he could get some of evang's special potatoes, mralvin woke up at 430AM. When he arrived at 4:40AM, there were already 400 people in line. As alvin stood in line, he noticed that every 5 minutes, 3 more people joined the line. How many people were in line at 5:00AM?

"I'm coming!" huffed mrhx as he ran as fast as he could to the evang's potato line. "I'm coming!" But it was too late. It was 8:18AM, and there were already 2034 people in line. Using the information from the previous question, what time should hx have arrived in order to get some of the potatoes?

mr daniel watched as everyone headed towards evang's potato line. It didn't matter to him though. He didn't want any potatoes. His favorite food was donuts. The closest Dunkin Donuts was 720 meters away. at 7:40AM, as everyone streamed by, daniel headed the opposite direction to Dunkin Donuts, walking at a speed of 9 meters every minute. What time will daniel arrive at Dunkin Donuts?

Unfortunately, what daniel didnt account for was that this morning, there would be lots and lots of traffic due to the once-in-a-life-time event of evang's potatoes. As a result, his traveling speed would be 3 times slower. What time does daniel actually arrive at Dunkin Donuts?

"It's Kaylee!" shouted Daniel when he arrived at Dunkin Donuts. Indeed, mskaylee was sitting at one of the booths munching on a delicious strawberry frosted donut. Like Daniel, Kaylee's favorite food was also donuts. "Hi Daniel." "Kaylee, that donut looks delicious. How much does it cost?" "1 dollar and 35 cents." Daniel pays for the donut with all quarters. How much change does he get back?

all throughout the day, Mr. Aaron watched as evang handed out bags and bags of potatoes. These were the biggest potatoes he had ever seen. Each was the size of a football. The potato must have weighed at least 5 pounds. To convert pounds to ounces, there are 16 ounces in one pound. How many ounces does one of evang's potatoes weigh?

A normal potato usually only weighes 8 ounces. How many normal potatoes do you have to put together to get the weight of one of evang's potatoes?

Sichuan stir-fried potatoes with soy sauce, seseme oil, ginger, and garlic. This is the recipe msgrace was thinking about as she stood in her kitchen.

as a result of kaylee’s excellent score, all of the younger students wanted to learn her secrets. "my secret?" said Kaylee. "The key is to eat a healthy breakfast."
thats a wonderful secret1 said mrhx

more whispered ms grace, who wasn’t a very loud speaker.
ms emily waved her hands. "more!"
“well”, said kaylee, my second secret is to do some light stretching before the test. Stretching helps your body carry oxygen to the brain. More oxygen in the brain means it's big brain time.
the 4th graders took out their notepads and wrote down kaylee’s second secret.
only someone who scored 90,000% on a test would know something as smart as that! said mrdan
what else! asked mr alvin.

for the next 5 hours, Kaylee told secret after secret.
“No more!” cried Kaylee as the clock hit the 6th hour. She looked as if she was about to fall over. “I’m thirsty. I need a drink of water.”
“Just one more secret” cried msmch. I also want to score 90,000% on a test.
Teach us your ways Kaylee echoed Daniel.

“Okay fine1 My 144th secret is to use a sharp pencil with a good eraser.”
And before anyone else could ask another question, Kaylee ran off to get a drink of water.

Based on the information in the passage, how many secrets does Kaylee tell per every 15 minutes?  /prop(6 144 0.25 x)

Tips:
Any time you see the words "how many" and "every [insert number here]", it is probably a ratio question. A ratio question usually gives you 3 numbers, and your job will be to set up the ratios to find the missing fourth number.

thats right mralvin. instead, today, we shall learn about chocolate chip cookies.
how many chocolate chips should we put on each cookie?
How about 100?
But there are only 50 chocolate chips in the bag mrhx.
Let's put 9 chocolate chippies on each cookie. 
But if we do that, we will only be able to make 5 cookies. And there are 7 of us.
Msmch, how do you know we can only make 5 cookies?
Because the pattern is 9 chocolate chips for 1 cookie.
Which means 18 chocolate chips for 2 cookies.
27 for 3 cookies.
36 for 4 cookies.
45 for 5 cookies.
54 for 6 cookies.
But wait mrlucas1 we cant do 6 cookies because we only have 50 chocolate chips in the bag.
mch thats exactly right mrdan. Since 54 chocolate chips goes over how much we have, that means the most we can have is going to be 5 cookies. 

Which means we will have 5 chocolate chips leftover. What will we do with these delicious chippies?
We will feed them to Bobbert. He loooooves chocolate chippies.
Who's Bobbert?

E Good morning everyone.
Aaron Good morning Elina.
Kloe Good morning friends.
E Kaylee, aren’t you going to say good morning?
K No Elina. I’m sorry, but I’m too excited. I don’t have time to say good morning. I just want to start learning about percentages. Right! Now!
Aaron I got you! Percentages are all around us. For example, a 90% score on a test.
Kloe Or a 30% chance to rain.
K Or a 0.0001% chance of getting hit by lightning. 
E For math, one of the most popular kinds of percentage questions that you will see is called decimal conversion. 
K What’s that?
A Basically, you convert a percentage into a decimal. And then you multiply by something. And then sometimes you add, and sometimes you subtract.
Kloe Here’s an example question. John has 10 dumplings. 40% are shrimp-flavored. How many dumplings are shrimp flavored?
A The first step is decimal conversion. 40% becomes 0.4.
Kaylee Wait. How did you do that?
A I don’t know. You just do it. Like this: 40% becomes 0.40 which is the same as 0.4. 
E 140% becomes 1.4.
Kloe 33% becomes 0.33.
A 5% becomes 0.05.
E 11% becomes 0.11
A 12% becomes 0.12
K So, basically, you move the decimal over 2 places to the left?
A Exactly!
Kloe Step 2. Multiply. 10 times 0.4 = 4.
E Step 3. You’re done! The answer is 4.
K That’s it? 
E That’s it!
K But I bet it can get harder.
A Nothing is hard when you believe in yourself.
Kaylee But sometimes, it’s hard to believe in yourself. 
E That’s what friends are for. They will help you believe in you.
Kaylee How?
Kloe By believing in you. 
Kaylee Do you believe in me?
Kloe Of course. I’m your friend.
A It’s the power of friendship!
Elina You can do it Kaylee!
Kaylee I can do it!
A The next question is “What is 30% of 20?”
Kaylee Isn’t this the same as the dumpling question? Don’t you just do 0.3 times 20?
E Exactly! The answer is 6.
Kaylee Harder!
Kloe What is 30% more than 20?
Aaron Remember what I said earlier about how you multiply, and then sometimes you add or subtract? Well that’s what we do now. 30% of 20 is 6. 30% more than 20?
Kaylee You just add it on!
Aaron Yes!
Kaylee So the answer is 26?
Aaron Yes!
Kaylee Harder!
Elina What is 30% less than 20?
Kaylee The answer is 14 because 20 - 6 equals 14?
Elina Yes!
Kaylee Harder!
Kloe What is 30% less than 30% more than 30% less than 30% more than 20?
Kaylee No.
Kloe Okay no.
Elina Are we finished?
Aaron Yeeeeeeee!
