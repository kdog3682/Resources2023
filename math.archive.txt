# Trailing Zeroes don't matter.

4 is the same as 4.0 which is the same as 4.00 which is the same as 4.00000. Basically, a number can have an endless amount of trailing zeroes.

Can I write 1.23 with a million trailing zeroes?
If you want to. But it might take a very long time to write.


# The Trick to Adding and Subtracting Decimals is Trailing Zeroes

1.6 + 1.23

1.23 has 2 decimal places.
1.6 only has 1 decimal place.

What do we do? Can we still add them together?

Of course. 
We just give 1.6 a trailing zero.
1.6 becomes 1.60.
Now it is smooth sailing.
