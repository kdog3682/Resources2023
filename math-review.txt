#Big Multiplication
What does 1 trillion times 2 trillion times 3 trillion equal?

When you see a big question like this, usually there is a simple answer. 

Trillion has 12 zeroes.

When  you multiply big numbers, put all of the zeroes into your pocket.

12 zeroes into your pocket for the first million.
12 for the second.
And 12 for the third.

In total, that is 36 zeroes.

Now, just do 1 times 2 times 3.
Take the 36 zeroes out of your pocket and put it onto your answer.

The final answer is a 6 with 36 zeroes.

#Converting Minutes
How many minutes are there in 90 seconds? 

The answer is 1 minute and 30 seconds.

This is an OKAY answer.

But we can have a better answer.

Is there a way to turn 30 seconds into minutes?

There is! 30 seconds is HALF of a minute.

The final answer is 1 1/2 minutes.

#Finding the Missing Number
400 times X equals 40,000. What number does X equal?

What is the difference between 400 and 40,000?

The 40,000 has 3 extra zeroes.

I think the answer is 1,000 because 1,000 has 3 extra zeroes.

Let's check our answer and do 400 times 1,000. If it works, we will get 40,000.

4 times 1 = 4. 
There are 5 zeroes in total.
The answer is 4 with five zeroes: 40,000.
Our answer is correct!

# Solving Variables

A + B = 18
A and B are different numbers.
A is FIVE TIMES as big as B.
What number could A be and what number could B be?

This question is called a multi-variable question.

"multi" means multiple.

"variable" is referring to the letters A and B.

We have seen variables a lot already. Every time we solve for "X", we are actually doing a variable question.

$, guess a number for B.

I'll guess B = 1. 
The rule is A is 5 times B. That means A = 5.

But this doesn't work. 1 + 5 doesn't equal 18. $, guess again.

This time, I'll guess B = 2.
But it still doesn't work.
If B = 2, and A is 5 times more, that means A is 10.
But 10 + 2 doesn't equal 18.

This time, I'll guess B = 3.
That means A = 15.
It works! 15 + 3 = 18.
The final answer is A = 15 and B = 3.

#Number Pattern
Each number in the pattern has an additional 2.
q
Level 1 2
Level 2 22
Level 3 222
Level 4 2222
q
How many digits will the number in Level 10 have?

$, how many digits, do you think Level 5 will have?

Level 5 will probably be 22,222. That is 5 digits.

Don't we have to add 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2?

We dont have to do that. The question just wants the number of digits.

In that case, I think I know what to do. 
Each level basically tells you the number of digits. Level 1 has only one 2. Level 2 has two 2s.
The final answer for Level 10 will be TEN 2s.

#Sammy the Snail

Every day Sammy the snail climbs one inch.
How many weeks will it take Sammy to climb 6 feet?

Is it possible to do this question? They give us days, but they want weeks.

This type of question is called a "conversion" question. We just have to convert the days to weeks, and then we can do it.

But first, let's convert feet into inches.
There are 12 inches in one feet and we have 6 feet.

12 times 6 equals 72 inches.

What we have is Sammy climbing one inch a day, and he needs to get to 72 inches.

Week 1 = Sammy climbs 7 inches.
Week 2 = 14 inches
Week 3 = 21

Basically, we are counting by 7s because Sammy does 7 inches in a week.

7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77

7 * 10 = 70. Is the answer 10 weeks?

Sammy needs 72 inches. 10 weeks is not enough. 

The answer is 11 weeks!

#Apples and Oranges
An apple costs 1 dollar more than an orange.
Together, they cost 2 dollars. How many quarters does the orange cost?

Each X represents a quarter. 
q
X X X X
X X X X
q
The apple costs 1 dollar more.

The apple is going to be 6 quarters. That's $1.50.
The orange is going to cost 2 quarters. That's $0.50.
The answer is correct because 1.5 + 0.5 adds up to 2 dollars.

#Cake

We start with one whole cake. Sam eats 1/3 of the cake. How much cake is left?

At the very start, before Sam starts eating we have a WHOLE cake.

WHOLE means 1.

And 1 means anything/anything.

Does 1 equal 1/1 ?

Yup

1 = 153/153 ?

Yup. But for this question, we will choose 1 = 3/3 so that the denominators match.

The final answer is 3/3 - 1/3 = 2/3
----------------

#Fractions and Division are the Same

I have a question $. Why does 1 = anything/anything?

It is because fractions and division are the same thing. 
When you divide 153 by 153, the answer is 1.
When you divide anything by the same number, the answer is always 1.

#Fraction with Different Denominators

What does 3/5 - 1/6 equal?

This is one of the most popular fraction questions.

It is more advanced than simple fractions because both of the denominators are DIFFERENT.

When the denominators are different, we have to get them to become the same.

But how?

There are a few ways. 
Felix's favorite way is called "cross-multiply." This is the fastest way of doing it.
Bonnie's favorite way is called "guess and match." This is the medium way of doing it.
Mr. Lee's favorite way is called "convert one step at a time." This is the slowest way.

Can we do it Felix's fast way?

We are going to do it Mr. Lee's way.

Mommmmmy I don't want to! I don't want to do it the slow way.

I'm not your mommy $.

Please $, Not the slow way. Anything but the slow way. I don't want to be a turtle.

Okay fine. We will do it Bonnie's way: guess and match.

$, How do we do Bonnie's guess and match method?

Our question is 3/5 - 1/6.
The first step is to guess a number that both denominators can go into.

Hmm. 5 and 6 can both go into ... 15?
No. 6 doesn't go into 15.
5 and 6 can both go into 30!

The second step is to match 3/5 to 30.
The rule is anything you multiply to the bottom, you also have to multiply to the top.

5 times 6 equals 30.
Therefore, we also multiply the top by 6.
3 times 6 = 18.

The fraction 3/5 becomes the new fraction 18/30.
We are almost there.
Now, we do it again for the other fraction.

1/6 times 5 on top and bottom will match with 30.
1/6 becomes 5/30.

We put everything together.
3/5 - 1/6 becomes 18/30 - 5/30.
The final answer is 18 - 5 = 13/30.

#Equivalent Fractions

How do you urn 3/5 into an equivalent fraction with denominator 20?

It's like this, $. 3/5 becomes 6/10 becomes 9/15 becomes 12/20.
The answer is 12/20

I don't really get it.

To make an equivalent fraction, take your starting fraction and multiply it by any number on top and bottom.

3/5 times 1 on top and bottom is 3/5.
3/5 times 2 on top and bottom is 6/10.
3/5 times 3 on top and bottom is 9/15.
3/5 times 4 on top and bottom is 12/20.
q
I get it!

#Divisibility Rules
Is 123,418 divisible by 4?

The first 2 digits are the ONES place and the TENS place.
I don't think 18 is divisible by 4.

Great job. That means 123,418 is NOT divisible by 4.

----------------
#Divisibility

I am divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,6. What number am I?

Well, the answer is not 10.

Maybe 15? Nope. It's not 15.

How do we do this problem?

I guess we just have to keep guessing.

... 5 hours later.

The answer is 60!
