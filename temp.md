09-21-2023 When a Boy Finds Meaning
09-21-2023

When a boy finds meaning, 

he starts to grow up.
he starts to grow gentle.
he starts to understand himself.

The boys of age 18
The boys of age 24
The boys of age 30
The boys of age 36

We are the same boy as ever before.
But little things change.
The meanings inside of us are being discovered over and over again.

She will do little things for him
He will do little things for her
