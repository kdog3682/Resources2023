“Hmm”, said Mr. Hu. He decided to give Daphne a little test. "I'm building a chimney for my wife. What type of brick would you recommend?"

Without hesitating, Daphne replied, "You will need fire bricks." 

"That is correct," said Mr. Hu. He took off his glasses to get a better look at Daphne. "I would also like to decorate the outside of the chimney."

"Use facing bricks if you would like decorative patterns. Use clinker bricks for a more traditional or rustic look."

"You really know your stuff!" said Mr. Hu excitedly.

Example 1: 1/0.1 has a decimal place in the bottom. Multiply the top and bottom by 10 because there is 1 decimal place.

Example 2: 0.23/0.00000009

There are 8 decimal places in the denominator. There are 2 decimal places in the numerator. The winner is 8. Multiply the top and bottom with 8 zeroes. 

8 zeroes means "times 100,000,000".

The denominator's 8 decimal places will cancel with the 8 zeroes. We will be left with the number 9.

For the numerator, if we are multiplying by 8 zeroes, that means we shift RIGHT 8 times.

Current: 0.23
1 shift: 2.3  
2 shift: 23
3 shift: 230
4 shift: 2300
5 shift: 23000
