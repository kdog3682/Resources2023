Hi $$$

----------------
hi hammy. How are you?
----------------
h hammy needs help
----------------
what's wrong? $ and I will help you
----------------
h I am stuck on a decimal multiplication question. The question is

    0.2 * 0.004 * 0.05
----------------
You can totally do this q h. 

$ and I will show you the steps.

----------------

Step 1. Count up all of the decimal places. How many do you see?
----------------

h 

Hammy sees

0.2 has 1 decimal place
0.004 has 3 decimal places
0.05 has 2 decimal places

In total there are 6 decimal places
----------------
gj hammy. you're absolutely right.
Now keep this number in your head as we go on to step number 2.
----------------
Step 2. Pretend there's not a single decimal place in the question
----------------

0.2 * 0.004 * 0.05


h okay

Then the question will be 2 * 4 * 5 which equals 40.
The answer is 40!
----------------
You're super close h.
There's just one more thing you hav

h but hammy doesnt have pockets
----------------
does hammy have a backpack for extra cakes?
----------------
h of course!
----------------
put the decimals into your cake backpack h
----------------
bold 0.2 has 1 decimal. 

Put the decimal into your backpack.

@float
0.2 -> 2
Now it's not 0.2 anymore. It's just the normal number `2`
----------------

0.004 has 3 decimals. 
That means 3 more decimals into h's backpack

@float
0.004 -> 4
It's not 0.004 anymore. It's just the normal number `4`
----------------
$next, why are we doing this?

----------------

Because decimals are scary
By turning the decimals into regular numbers, it simplifies the question
----------------
h, would you rather do 0.12 times 0.6 or 12 times 6?

most people will choose 12 times 6. 
----------------
h h would rather eat cake
----------------
focus h
we will do math first and then we can eat cake after

----------------



bold 0.004 has 3 decimals. 
We put all 3 decimals into the backpack. 0.004 becomes just 4.

bold 50 has 1 extra zero. 
Put the extra zero into the backpack. 
----------------
At last, we can multiply everything together.
----------------
h 2 times 4 times 5 equals 40
----------------
good job h. now take everything out of your backpack and put it back onto the number
----------------
h even h's cakes? 
----------------
not your yummy cakes.
just the decimals and the extra zeroes

----------------
There was 1 extra zero.
Put it onto the 40. 
----------------
h The 40 becomes 400
----------------
There were 4 extra decimals.
That means we are going to shift 400 left by 4 times.

shift(400, -4, answer=1)
----------------
And that's all you have to do h.

Sometimes the question will have bigger numbers.
----------------





Multiplying by Zeroes

It could work.
