## Introduction Letter

Hello,

My name is Kevin. I would like to apply for your position of teaching Grade 3 to Grade 5 math.

I have worked many years teaching math to students of all ages. Much of my early experience was teaching SHSAT and SAT math. In recent years, I have transitioned to teaching elementary grade math.

My main goals as a math teacher is 1) to help students build solid foundations, and 2) to help them achieve small wins. I believe small wins are the key for improvement because they build self-confidence, self-belief, and create positive momentum for doing well.

I hope you will consider me as a candidate for this teaching position. I believe I can give your students a strong summer math education.

Thank you,
Kevin
