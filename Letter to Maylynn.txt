Hey Maylynn,

Want to live with me in Brooklyn your first year in New York?

We can get a nice (not too nice) place. I'll ask mom and dad for help paying it.

You will still be able to party/bars/clubs/sleepover with your friends on the weekends.

There is lots of great food and bars in brooklyn. Brooklyn is a pretty cool place. Street festivals every weekend. Clubs. Most young people live in Brooklyn. The subway is safe to ride. Everyone rides the subway. Yes, there were incidents of asian hate crime. But there are many more police in the subways now. Most of the time, there will always be other people, even at like 3AM in the morning. 

There will definitely be opportunities to move-in with your classmates. People are always happy to have more roommates to share the rent.

Maybe give it some thought?
