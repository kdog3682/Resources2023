Vincent,

When you say the word "easy",
Your brain stops working as hard.

Grow strong Vincent.

Grow stronger and stronger and stronger. s:bold

Instead of saying "this assignment is easy",

You can say,

"This assignment was not that hard for me. However, I still have a long way to go. I still have many more things to learn."
