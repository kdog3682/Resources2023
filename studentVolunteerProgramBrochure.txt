WHY?????????

My Reason #1

One day, I would like to start a learning center.
This program is a good training ground for young high schoolers.
Who knows. Maybe a young high schooler discovers he or she likes teaching.

My Reason #2

A few months ago, my friend asked me to recommend her son for a job.
Her son is a college student.
But he had zero experience.
If her son had a program like this when he was in high school, it would be much easier to give him a recommendation.


My Reason #3

This stuff is fun for me.
Everyone benefits.
I benefit.
High school students benefit.
Elementary students benefit.



Your Reason #1

Money

Your Reason #2

Volunteer hours


Your Reason #3

Meaning


MONEY

The most important thing. (Just kidding. Meaning is actually more important)
But seriously. Money is the most important thing.


REQUIREMENTS

You do not need to be perfect.
You do not need to be good scores.
Your history does not matter.



Do I have to be a serious person?

You don't have to be serious.
But you do have to take things seriously.

This is Stephen Curry.
He isn't that serious right now.
But he is taking it serious.



Can I goof off with my friends and say the words "bruh" and "sup dog"?

No.

The elementary students are going to call you Mr. X and Miss. X.
Therefore, you need to act like a Mr. and a Miss.

After the students have departed, 
You can say whatever you want.

When the students are there,
you must create a feeling of safety.

Joking around with your teaching partner does not create a feeling of safety.
It creates the feeling that this is just a high schooler goofing around.


MONEY

The money comes from the parents.
The money will be spent on food.
The rest of the money goes to you.

All of the expenses will be posted publicly.

Warning: You might not be paid very much.


COMPENSATION

So ... money is the most important thing.
But ... you might not be paid very much.

What ???

Sample Math: 
Pricing: 45 dollars a month

10 parents sign up = 10 students = 450 dollars.
Teaching ratio is approximately 1 to 2 = 5 teachers.

Total people = 15
Food expenses for 1 month for 15 people = 100 dollars
Money currently at: 350 dollars.

350 divided by 5 teachers = 70 dollars a month.


COMPENSATION

    Here are some samples:

    I would like to do this teaching job to gain experience for education. I have always been passionate about teaching ...

    Score: ZERO.
    Reason: It doesn't saying about how it will benefit you.

    I have a lot to offer as a student teacher. I am a diligent student who takes her studies seriously, and I am always eager to learn new things.

    Score: ZERO
    Reason: It doesn't saying about how it will benefit you.


    I do not want to read anything about:

        1. I am doing this to help the children in Africa.
        2. I am doing this to save the world.
        3. Your straight As and your work ethic.
        4. Your past experiences.
        5. Being a honorable person.

    I want to read about how this work will benefit you.

    Maybe you really are doing this to save the world.
    Maybe this truly lives in your heart.

    Tie it to you.
    Make it personal.

    "I am doing this to save the world."  No.
    "Doing this might change the world. 
    It will bring me one step closer to X.
    This will make me feel happy."


    The standard job application, college admission essay is a bit different.

    
    Why does this application solely want to focus on you?

    Short Answer:
    
    When you have a good reason for your actions,
    You won't get bored.

    Here are some sample essays.

    Essay Score: LOW
    Reason: Zero heart.





    

 






    How can you personally


The best teacher has 2 qualities.

    1. You care about the student.
    2. You have defeated challenges.

Students can smell right away if they have a good teacher.



























    1. Take a math or english or chinese test.
    Take a test for the subject you want to teach.
    To teach multiple subjects, you will need to take multiple tests.
    Everyone teaches english.


    No requirements.
    But a training period of 3 months.

    Training Period Compensation:
        
        Money = $0 a month
        Letter of Recommandation for school/jobs = 1 a month
        pizza / hamburger / sandwich = once a week
        Volunteer Hours = yes


To be a teacher, all you need is one quality.
Being smart is okay, but that's not the quality.
Being tall and powerful is nice, but that's not the quality.

The quality is heart.

A 15 year old kid with a lot of heart is going to be a much better teacher than a 50 year old teacher who doesn't like teaching.

Performance Review

After a while, the kids are going to like you.
You could do a bad job, and the kids will still like you.

Nobody does a bad job on purpose.
Maybe they lose motivation.
Maybe they don't want to do it anymore.
Maybe they aren't being paid enough.

I do not want to "fire" anyone.
You guys are younger than 30 years old.

Younger than 30 years old means:

    your brain is still developing






You need to make a YouTube Video after every session.
