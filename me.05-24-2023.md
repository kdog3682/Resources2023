Firebase Directory: 

    I dont think it needs to be used.
    We are not using a server.
    We are using the SDK.
    I think you can just include the firebase config thing from anywhere.

    The firebase rabbit hole is endless.
    Use what you need.
    When you need more, go ahead and configure it.

    But as of right now, it is not necessary.
    Do not need remote config.
    Do not need analytics. (You can report your own style of events)
    Do not need real time updates.
    Do not need auth (for now).

Implicit saves time when you know what is coming.
But then you forget about it ... and things break.

Having too many versions can also break things.

rollup is a very useful tool.
rollup.config.js is not actually necessary.
You can use rollup programatically which I think is more flexible.

The reason I started using rollup is because syntaxHighlighting does not show up in the codemirror.js bundle from the codemirror website.

I kind of do want syntax highlighting.
There is a very robust system going on.

     __create__ is called on all child creation methods
     __init__ is called upon entering the constructor

     Example init for Vob:

        this.tag = 'div'
        this.type = type2(this)
        this.component = ''
        this.listeners = {}
        this.classes = []
        this.events = {}

        switch (type2(x)) {
            case 'Object': 
                classToClasses(x)
                Object.assign(this, x)
                return 
            case 'String': 
                if (isHtmlTag(x)) {
                    this.tag = x
                } else {
                    this.addClass(x)
                }
                return 

    Init essentially determines how the incomign data is assigned

A few tips on working with friends:

Ancient Proverbs

    The first best way to lose a friend is to lend them money.
    The second best way to lose a friend is to work with them.

Two tits for 1 tat (2T41T)

Tit for Tat (T4T) is a game-theory strategy.
You hurt me. I hurt you.

2T41T beats T4T.

It goes like this:
    You hurt me.
    Okay fine. You have one more before I retaliate.


There are many game-theory strategies.
The T4T strategy beats most of them.


2T41T always beats T4T.
But 2T41T does poorly in an environment with many diverse strategies.

For example, 2T41T always loses to "Always Attack" whereas T4T never loses to "Always Attack."

When you are working with a friend or a small group of friends, this is not an environment of "many diverse retalation strategies."

In small environments where the participants are known, 2T41T does extremely well. It yields net plus for everyone.

The AA strategy, on the other hand, does horrible in small environments where all participants are known. A group of AA's working together yields net negatives for everyone.

Worst Case Scenarios

    You give everything
    Your partner is just along for the ride


How to prevent these worst case scenarios?


Preventing Worst Case Scenarios


When you ask for a group project at Brooklyn Learning...

Step 1: You will be entered into a candidate pool.

The amount of work that you haave done.
The quality of your work.
A general purview of your abilities.
Your project interests.

If another candidate matches your abilities and your project interests and your work ethics, we go to step 2. Otherwise, keep waiting.

Step 2:

You will get an email that looks like this.
Your prospective partner will get the same email, but from the opposite perspective.

Dear Sam,

On August 4th, 2018, you submitted a request for a group project.
Today is September 25, 2023, and a potential partner has been found.

Here are some details about your partner:

name: John
age: high school junior
residence: california
coding interests:
    foobar
    goobar

Our matching system has determined that the two of you have matching work ethics. You have both completed over 500 problems.

You have both passed metric levels 1 and 2. We believe, and we hope,  the two of you can do good work together.

But just because these external factors match, does not necessarily mean, it will be a good match.


Step 3:

A joint proposal.
How you will do it.
Timelines.

A mentor will be assigned to you.
Your mentor will be someone who works in the technology industry and can give the two of you help.

It is possible, that your joint proposal will be rejected.
Maybe no mentor is interested in your project.
Or maybe your proposal was written poorly.

What should you do?

You can do it without a mentor.
You can submit your proposal again.

It is highly recommended that you do it with a mentor.

Sam and Ham work together.
Sam is doing more work.

It is not comfortable for Sam to tell Ham, "Ham, I am doing more than you. This is not fair. Can you do more too?" 

But a mentor can do this pretty comfortably.
Your mentor will be someone in their 30s, 40s, 50s.

Sometimes, we make dumb decisions. Say dumb things.

The Path of Least Resistance

The most normal thing in the world is for teamwork to fall apart.
Teamwork is like a tower of sticks.
So many little things can break it.

Working together with your friends is fun.

Your function takes in a paragraph of 3 sentences as an argument.
If the third sentence needs to be auto-completed, auto-complete the third sentence.
Afterwards, return the paragraph.



Longer Division

When using a calculator, division often truncates at 10 decimal places.




How could you make a division question that will have a predefined number of decimals places?

    @template a/b = $calc(a/b) ($decLength decimal $plural(place, $))
    7 5 
    6 4
a/b = $calc(a/b) ($decLength decimal $plural(place, $))

The Golden Path of Excellence

Is not golden at all.
Is filled with twists and turns.

To have a mission to embue something.
We are jelling together.

To host it.
To put your name on it.
To create the feelings in vivo.
That I continued to make the assignments.

And this time, they could've looked incredible.

Some things you cannot say.
Even if you want the assurance.

The lessons that I slowly learn.


Top 

The power of putting your soul into those you watch over.
There are different ways of giving this power.

Feel the power from afar.
But at the same time to not submerge them in it.

As a group.
But at the same time ... alone.

Mike Brown ... losing to his former boss.
It isn't fun.
But Mike Brown wants to win just as much.


Where is it?
To make an edit.
Make it happen.

A new story.


Is that it?
Is that all?

To have impacted.
To create cruelty from what is left over.
This is what losing hope looks like.
This is what losing hope feels like.

When other people cannot see you.
You have to see yourself.

The feeling of being all alone.
Mr. Lee never went back.

A good thing became a bad thing.
Take on new friends.
He doesnt come anymore.
He fixed the hoops like 20 times.

Everything broken down.
Darren's pain.

Yes. 
Bad feelings will always arise.
The objective then, is to minimize them as much as possible.

Without thankfulness, you are blowing dust into the wind.
Without gratefulness, none of it matters.

When your name is on it, it immediately becomes familiar.
The way of preparation means I need not  give certain explicit advantages.

A writer.
Selling my abilities to the highest builder.

Define a simple lezer grammar.

Grammars and AST Trees -- I did not start this until my 4th year.

A way of dynamically running code.

Running your code one step at a time.
You would not think to tell a story like that ... but it absolutely works

I think the general idea will be to create a data json.
The json will be split into css / js / html.

You can even move things around.
You can possibly zoom in and zoom out.

At periodic intervals, you can update the final css.

In general patients with acute ITP will only rarely have life-threatening bleeding.[46] most of the patients ultimately have stable but lower platelet counts which is hemostatic for a person. Unlike in pediatric patients who can be cured; most of the adults will run a chronic course even

Platelets help blood coagulation

In adults, particularly those living in areas with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and has been associated with peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients.FCGR3a

With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat based on platelet counts. Many older recommendations suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/µl) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment only in cases of significant bleeding. Treatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.

Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines[14] and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.[15]

Signs include the spontaneous formation of bruises (purpura) and petechiae (tiny bruises), especially on the extremities, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, and menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per μl.[3] A very low count (<10,000 per μl) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.

Any time you request data, you have to "wait" for it.

For this reason, we use the keyword "await"

await request()

What happens if you forget to write 'await' ?
You won't get any data.

await sleep(3)

The program will sleep for 3 seconds.

What happens if you forget to write 'await' ?
The program won't sleep.

async stands for 'asynchronous'.

When do you need to await?
    You need to await for sleep.
    You need to await for data-fetching.
    You need to await for promises.


If the block includes await... 
The top level function is given async.

If the block has async and it is not using await, async will be removed.
The determiner is the word await. The tree performs incremental advances.

Do a global search.
Automatically include or disclude async.

I guess my grand plan is a shotgun approach of creating surplus.
But it has to feel special.
Surplus in the framework of specialness.

The key is surplus.
Surplus seems to solve all problems.
Creating environments that echo of surplus.

My pet hobby is learning Chinese.
To not have any friends? I suppose.

To give something that sets you ahead x10.
To expect nothing out of it.

I feel like there is a chance.

Try a sample.
To do the designs in a custom language.
A reporting syntax.

One that calls into other languages.

To be late with cooking today.




To be angry.





Words will not be believed.
And assigning assignments like that will do nothing.
To do it from an individual perspective.










That collaboration is not safe because it has always been scarce.

Just because an element is indented ... doesnt necessarily mean it is a leaf.
You do not know the state of the element until after the parsing is finished.

So you go at it in 2 sweeps.
The first sweep to set data.
The second sweep to put the data together.

When teachin something, I dont think it is necessary to say why it is important. importance is often self-generated. you have to personally connect the dots in order for it to all fall in line together

You cannot tell a student why something is important.

FAQ

Writing a text message in this formal way will make me feel fake because I am not used to it.

A lot of things feel unnatural at first.
But the more you do it, and the more you see results, the more natural it will become.

What if I am talking to someone I know? Do I still need to be professional?

Professional ... not necessarily.
Respectful, genuine, meaningful: yes.

Eric Basketball Tips

An important ability in basketball is shooting.
But what happens ... when you cant shoot?

A teacher who cannot see.  can teach a class?
A musician who cannot hear.  can compose music?
An athlete without legs. can run a marathon?
A person with one arm.   can still do pushups?
A motivational speaker who is dyslexic.  can motivate crowds?
A doctor who is dying.  can still be a doctor?


Bad at X = Avoid X

This is normal.

Going home. 



After all, 
when there is earthquake,
go away from the earthquake.

This is the most normal thing.


Earthquakes from planet earth.
Earthquakes from inside us.

there is a big difference


The earthquake inside is much scarier.

Have you ever entered a situation, and you just know,

"I am going to fail at this."

Well just practice 10-15 times. 100-150 times. 1000-1500 times.
And you'll get better.

Strategies for Non-Shooters

Have a plan before you catch the ball.

Shooters don't need a plan.
Their plan is just to score.


Non-shooters need a plan.
笨鸟先飞

Chinese Proverb: The dumb bird flies first.

Plan 1: Dribble Hand-off.

Someone passes you the ball and you catch the ball.
Dribble the ball.

Plan 2: Don't stand still.

This way, no one will pass you the ball.
Instead, bounce around like a ping-pong ball. 

Set a screen on player1 1 for 2 seconds.
Now bounce to a new location.
Set another screen.

This is essentially the philosophy of Golden State Warrior non-shooters.
They just set screens, making life hard for the defense team.

Plan 3: You need one location where you can shoot.
When you catch the ball in this location, you have to shoot it.

To be scared.
Good pass.
The ability to hound you on defensive.

To be part of it.
That

Removing the child ... from the parent... is correct because it is no longer part of the flow. But it causes problems. A more robust way of doing it was to simply mark it...



I don't hate you for failing. I love you for trying.
He does construction work.
On Sunday, playing ball with your friends.
One day a week, not easy. 3 ge jing yi ge

There is something fierce about it.
He cannot shoot. But his other elements are very strong.


So it is working ...
But some elements are not clear.

A small error.
In the setting of the parent.

float-plus accumulates accidental spaces which needs to be fixed.

Dont have access to context in each of the parsers.
I think this is correct. it lets the functions be more pure


One of the recurring difficulties is something changes ... and then everything which depends on it is affected. New elements HAVE to be introduced. But introducing them, often creates new mistakes.


05-09-2023 Coding

By coding everything as modules, less implicit dependencies are formed.
It is easier to run unit tests.
You can separate the pieces.
You can divide and conquer.

05-09-2023 Ambiguous Naming

Use options for functions and classes.
Use config for config files.

05-09-2023 Code Notes
    const tags = {
        'bold': 'em',
        'emoji': 'span',
        'link': 'a',
        'default': 'span',
    }
    const components = {
        'math': 'VMath',
    }
    const classes = {
        'default': 'prose',
    }

Stylistic preferences. 
Everything should be modularized.

These preferences.

Throughout your coding journey, you will hear lots of advice. Often, the advice will be contradictory.

Group A says
     "Don't use the name configuration. Use the variable name 'option'"

Group B says
     "That's wrong. You should use the variable name 'configuration'"

Who do you listen to?
Which one do you choose?
And does it even matter?

config vs. options
inheritance vs. composition
mutable vs. immutable programming
react vs. vue vs. angular
python vs. javascript
dont write comments vs. write lots of comments
one function per file vs 100 functions per file
dont use eval vs use eval
circular dependencies are okay vs. avoid circular dependencies
long variable names vs. short variable names
getters and setters cause confusion vs. they're very useful

Who is correct?

Both sides have valid arguments.
Ultimately, it is up to you.

For the most part, unless you ask me directly, I will not give a personal opinion. It is like asking, what is the better fruit to eat in the morning: apple or orange? I will say the answer is orange but is that actually true?

Coding, like writing, is creative. We have our own preferences.

Ultimately, for the first 1-3 years, it does not matter.
Things like composition and inheritance 

What everyone agrees on:

    Avoid Spaghetti Code

        You will know your code is spaghetti when you spend more time jumping back and forth then actually coding.


    Be Consistent

        The most powerful reason to be consistent is it allows for easy global scale edits. For example: changing words. Let one word mean one thing. This way, if you need to change that word to a different word, it is as simple as find and replace across all your documents.

    Avoid variable names like:

        fruit1
        fruit2
        fruit3


    Code for the Long Term

        Think about

In this manner, very interesting structures can be created.

The secondary goal is absorbing.

Action creates opportunities for the development of identity and agency
identity coms
agency: the sense that I am the one who is causing or generating an action
The more you act with action, the more agency you accumulate, the more your identity develops. "I am a person who passes the ball." This identity comes from the action of repeatedly passing the ball.

Asking Questions

    1. Ask in person
    2. Type it up and ask online (anonymous)
    3. Use your phone and click the button

No recommendations
No need to even say this.
No asking options questions.
Planting seeds for the future.
To not ask a single question about your reality.
To hang-out.
To like somebody.
To feel the way it goes.
Do you want to put this onto YouTube?

It is something that is effective.
You have no choice, but to be humble.
Mianba has always wanted to express his ego.
Sport as an expression of ego.
Beating me is kind of pointless.

Many times, Teamwork --> chaos and destruction

1 in a million, Teamwork --> masterpiece

Teamwork works when

no one is scared of stealing
no one is scared of betrayal
everyone feels safe
everyone brings valuable contribution
everyone has same goal
everyone is humble

When you eat together, when you play together, one person who wants to express the most out of it. To be unable to see me. He never talked about the work. He just comes to play.

They are going to be doing construction work for awhile.
Because of the construction work ... But it ends.

True friends will tell you, when you are in the wrong.
True friends, possibly have your back.

The parent (1st) generation
    Eric's parents
    Wei's parents
    Yijie and Diana
    Yaonan and Kai

The child (2nd) generation

The 1st generation will always have certain characteristics.
The 2nd generation will be
    low income
    middle class
    the striving class
    upper middle class

In every single instance, advocating for 'teamwork' is wrong.
The teacher can only advocate what the parents advocate.

The benefits of teamwork are felt without words.
Teamwork is intrinsically fun.
It is part of the human condition.
Our biological construction is wired for friendship because friendship equals survival. But along the way in Chinese history, friendship became equivalent to a comparative measure. Those closest to you, become your closest measuring sticks. And so friendship started to equate to competition and survival, but in the negative sense. But this is developed through time. Through the culture of 10,000 years. It is not the most natural state. It is the most familiar state. It is the default embedded state.

The phenotype which I seek to spread, cannot be spread through direct instruction. In order for it to

It is not necessary to apply a label of age.
Most labels are unnecessary.
The default state is defensiveness.

The kids who pass through.

To let him be Kobe.
To jump into the fray.
To get your money.

But what is that money ultimately worth?
Playing with your friends, is worth a certain amount of money as well.

The ball was constantly moving.

The pain of not having power.
The pain of not having language.
The pain of being weak.

As a friend, you cannot tell your friends what to do or change.
You can give a single suggestion, and that is it.
If they are open to the suggestion.
Bringing a net.

That is life. Good and bad are always together.

The moment you start the nonsense of picking teams, I am done. I think it is completely asinine. But I am not looking at it from their POV.

Rudy might be kind of Chinese. Maybe he doesnt know who he is. Somebody who enjoys kids. That is what I might be waiting for.

-------------

container centered numbered
    You are Player A
    Pass the ball to player B.
    Go set a screen on Player C. 
    Player C curls around the screen for an attack.

Simultaneously, after you set the screen, you have a few options:

    @numbered
    Cut to the hoop
    Go set another screen
    Pop to the 3 point line

After this sequence, effectively what has happened is:

    Player A becomes Player C
    Player C becomes Player B
    Player B becomes Player A

You can repeat the sequence 1 time, 2 times, many times.
Somewhere in the repeated sequence:

    1. somebody will be wide open. 
    2. there will be open lanes to the hoop.


Done properly, motion offense looks like a dance.

Hurts like a MFer.
Maybe too much acid in my diet.

Maybe my tongue licked the ground when I was sleeping.
Wipe down the ground before sleeping
Sleep face up.

The kids are between 10 and 20 years old.

To just let my teammates play their game.
That has kind of been my way of doing it.

It is a different feeling.
Somehow, I feel like George needs a hug and I dont know why.

To go down the lane for a layup whenever.
The feeling that I can do more.
A drive to the hoop. Or a bank shot. 

For some reason, playing with Mianba, it always feels like a loss can happen. It feels like we have zero teamwork. Our playing styles do not complement. 

The short jumper. Will always be there. Just have to step into it. And get lift off the ground. It is a shot that I should definitely take.

Limit the range. Drive to the hoop.
When it comes off of a pass.

To forget about every previous miss.



Post these basketball notes somewhere.
It is important to play hard against young players. Show them that you're not taking it easy. Certain verbal patterns become activated.

Why do you prefer teaching?

I like making fun assignments for students.
When teaching SHSAT/SAT, the curriculum is very straight forward.

Classroom Management is the hardest part for me.
I am a lot louder. To see everything all at once.

I don't have any questions.
I've been working on a side project.

That I no longer have the energy to give a full blast of enthusiasm. It is just not in me anymore. Boring answers.

To not be given any belief.
That you lose out on a person.
There is someone doing something there.

The difference of a rocketship or a jetpack. 

To be able to do all of it in my head.

Together.
Suicides.
Where the duck goes drinking water.
The good and the bad taken together.

Who are you? Believe in yourself.
They learn it in.

Reading the story again.

Making his decisions early.

I am trying to climb a very large mountain.
And I am kind of doing it by myself.

It is not even that severe.
For those people who suffer every day ... I cannot fathom.

Dave Chen

Very different energy from Charlie Leung.
He seems very meticulous. He is pretty respectful.
It went better than expected.

Will I hear back from him.
The inability to be flexible.
He will see many candidates and pick the one that fits his school.
That I have to advocate for my phenotype maybe.

Don't hold fast.
It's not far from here.
To not ask any questions.

These are immigrants.
To be respectful of the process.

Chaotic Good.
Chaotic Evil.

To put all of the materials together.

Everything was flimsy. 

Not far from here.
Yeah, it's not far from here.

Okay.
Um. I don't know. I'm not sure. Writing stories.
The ability to write these unreproducable stories.

He is reading my resume.
June to June.

The story of my resume says someone who gets bored easily. Or someone who isn't that reliable. We always left on good terms. We always left on good terms. Writing after. Paying cash.

Someone who takes his time.
To do both of it.

To just teach without writing.
Some teachers want to put their soul into it.
The way to do that is by creating the curriculum.

Freedom...

@bulletList


It blows their concept that it could be outdoor and fun.
Bayside ... 

Some teachers really want to use their own teaching materials. It creates a feeling of freedom. Some teachers just want a paycheck. 

They have these well-made workbooks.
A distributed system of workbooks.

That's cool.
Something you maybe didn't fully expect.

My formative years came from teaching ... 
It was hard to find teaching jobs in Seattle.
I said no lies.

Let Dave make his decisions.

What those boys need from me is not "volunteer opportunities." The thing that will be most valuable is a friend who cares about them.

To be underneath my thumb will not be fun for them.
To just be a friend ... is the most valuable thing of all.

Zero ulterior motives.
That is what is safe.
That is what they might project forward.

To mean serious business. That is what I lacked.
An interesting offer. 
We ended on good terms.
I am still happy to see them, and they are still happy to see me.

Discover the beast inside of you.

They're kids.

HS around MS feels the need to act over-mature.
HS around adults ... HS becomes like kids.

The older the people around you, the more childlike you become.
This is the relativity of age.

When you act as a kid, there are certain protective buffers that take hold. Somehow, it keeps you humble.

There is magic at play at Sunset Park. Something incredibly strange takes place. There are feelings of comraderie.

I can't find a job.
Sit at home and jack off.

Small business owner.

To take away some of the business.

Absorbing the personality of those around you.

But counter punchers can jab as well.

To never bring it up.

An ethos of celebration.
Practicing my phenotype.
To go earlier and earlier. 8:30AM. That is doable. Maybe.

43 year history. Yeah.
Believe it. But why do you have so much turn over?

To extract the capital value.
A few requests.
To teach upstairs.

I am a little bit claustrophobic.
To do a certain job. Come in ... and leave.

When new players come in and change the game.
It happens a little bit at a time.

Part of being a new yorker is being bound to earth. 
Part of being a small business owner is being bound by land grants.

Every year, the same actors spin their ships.
When the team goes for each other, you feel it intrinsically.

They are bloated.

"Elite Academy"
"Excel Academy"
"Excel Tutoring"

These are the names that assuage their feelings.
To bring the rambunction down.

Where the class is ... 
To work somewhere ... anywhere ...

That my writings are not supported here.
The feeling that you don't want me to write anything.

To teach 3 hours every morning.
That work only starts in the afternoon.

It was disrespectful.
I already made the decision to stop working.
But we could have had some more open discourse and dialogue.

Give me more work.
To trickle it in.
Give without asking.

The young ones need occassional protection. 

Postgame.
Let's go.

With the guys you just did battle with.
We're adults.
But adults still have the child inside of them.
That he recognized me.

To teach math. 2 hours. Kids can't still for that long.

Next time will be better.

Game stats. Counting your stats. 

To play out the selfishness.
Maybe it will change.
Maybe it won't.

Regardless, they have to play it out of their system.
One person's selfish play, may teach another player, to not be selfish.
There are net aggregates that can potentially happen.

I enjoyed teaching at CWT very much.
The kids will need a school to go to.

But I am not ready yet.

Sometimes you don't know what to say ...

I don't think we will have an older class this year.
That I can be disarming.

When you show that you mean business.
That was a long time ago.


To do these things.

Reading and writing.
Stuck to a certain aspect.

An element of fun. 
I wanted to infuse this.

But maybe ... this is the element that cannot be infused for the sake of survival.




We have so much to learn. 
Let's learn faster and faster.

When you wait too long, the circumstances will pass you by.
That is just how it goes.


































did you see the game last night.

"how lucky are we to play with friends."
























The sword.

You can buy it at the merch store. A homegrown team. 

Westbrook cannot change who he is.
Durant cannot change who he is.

In another world ... Dave Chen ... and I could be friends.
But not in this world.






































Creating a celebration.
Celebrate the things that you can celebrate.

We playing to win.
Coachable players.

Yaonan and Kai, Yijie and Diana. Are a litmus test.
If they like it. It has a chance.





To hold back.
Bring it in fellas.
We held them to 5 points.

Not for the offense.
To have someone who can be a father role.
A peer cannot touch that effect. Age has a true effect.
Joe Mazulla messed up a little bit.
Joe is too grumpy and one-dimensional. where is the joy?
joy is a crucial element to playing with flow 

not everything can be controlled because of chaotic random
order from chaos

the effects of age go as implicit respect.

To burst with elements unseen.

To be inflexible is a safety mechanism.


You can always get a game at Sunset Park.
To not let the kids have a chance to play.

All you need is 2 people to form a core and then the vibrations can begin to ping back and forth between the two towers. When you only have one person, it will take some time.

For the past week, I had an ulcer on my tongue.

So painful!

Eating hurts.
Talking hurts.
Wake up hurts.

I have had many ulcers, but this was the worst.

Feels like there is a burning hole.
Today, the pain has started to disappear.


Some things will never happen.
Some things might happen.
Some things will happen.

Important to define what will and will never.
Keeley's rule.
Anh's rule.
Many many more rules.
Trails of disaster and destruction.
But I will not repeat these mistakes.




The respect which we seek to gain.
The feeling of respect comes not from words, but from a life lived.

To have resources ready.
To not know who you are.
The appropriate distance.


All the little things.
I did all of the little things.

To have a strict rule set.
To have low teacher turn over.

The sacrifice that I made ... was maybe not my decision to begin with. To lose the ability to laugh. To lose the ability to laugh was the most ... Laughter is the most precious gift. Safety -> Trust -> Laughter.

Laughing with the kids.
The kids completely open up.

To be unable to see who I am.
Teaching kids.

I feel proud of myself. Someone who is 
To survive.

Someone ... who occupies my position.
To see if you enjoy the teaching process.

Paperwork.

$400 - $2400

Inflexible. Is what I keep experiencing.
The land teaches you to be inflexible.
Education will always be valuable. I believe this.

At the mercy of google reviews

Every small business owner of education seems to become exactly the same way. Squeezed for rent. The only way to go beyond this is to go to the land. To see who you are ... after awhile. 

A really disappointing day for me.

Even though you cannot see the students, and you cannot feel them, their feelings are real, and you have to honor them.

You have to honor them.

I will be struggling alone until I change a few things about myself.
The most important change is discipline.

I will be by myself until I figure out discipline. 
But things have slowly changed.
I am not as by myself as before.

I have better relationships.
I have friends.
I am calmer.

Discipline ... may be my life long struggle.

I was angrier in 2019 working for Mr. Li. I thought he was obstinate on certain matters. After working at Mr. Li, I didn't want to teach high school again. Making money to survive.

For some reason, I couldn't focus.

The view with Fiona was good enough.
The view with my basketball brothers is good enough.
The view with these kids is good enough.

My will will be passed. Not in its entirety. But some of it. An amount that can be passed.

After setting hundreds of screens, I have only received 3-5 screens. It is a ratio of about 100 to 1. Arguably not fair. 

Setting an offball screen.
Can I show you something.
To play smarter.
Playing good basketball.
It is a little boring.

Waiting for someone to play my brand of basketball.
Everyone plays one-on-one basketball. 
The way of Chinese culture is anti-helpfulness. This is my personal experience.

Yijie is my friend. But we don't have words for each other. Not today. Not in 10 years. Not in 50 years. To never give a reprimand, a directive, a command ... only in the role of a teacher. Keeley needed to survive. Where is Keeley? And how is she doing? So much brainpower wasted.

I do have a hidden agenda. One that is very obvious at the macroscale. One that lives in my every action. It is not a bad hidden agenda. Teamwork is dreamwork. Will I ever see it come into fruition? 

Teamwork is Dreamwork
Kindness
Discipline 
    my eternal weakness perhaps
    maybe because i go off of my temporary whims

Disposable is the path of least resistance for treating people.
Careless is the path of least resistance for treating yourself.
