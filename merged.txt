Prime Numbers



m = `/home/kdog3682/CWF/public/primes.txt------ 6 is NOT a prime nbr bc u can  it into 2t3.

5 is a prime number bc the only numbers that can multiply to 5 are 1 and 5.

Prime numbers can't be broken into smaller numbers.

6 can be written as 2t3. (NOT PRIME)
5 can only be written as 5t1. (PRIME)
Look.
The original number (5) shows up in the answer. 




hi mom, I have a q.
wts ur q sam?
y is 5 a prime number?

1 times 5 equals 5.
Mom, I know that. I'm not in third grade.
And that's why 5 is a prime number.

Hmm. Let me try one.
 1 times 6 eqs 6. 
 so 6 is a prime nbrqm

But you can also do 6 eqs 2 ts 3. that means 6 is not prime.

oh. I think I get it. 
 1 times 7 eqs 7.
 nothing else makes 7.
 that means 7 is a prime number?
great job sam. it most certainly is.

1 times 8 is 8.
but u can also do 2 times 4 eq 8.
8 is not prime.

thats right sam

mom, the rule is you look at how many roads there are. when there is only one road, it is a prime number.

for the number 20
you can do;
1t20
2t10
4t5
3 roads to 20 means
20 is not a prime number.

Sam, why did the prime number cross the road?

To be on the prime side!

rq
Think of the different ways of making: 13, 15, 99, and 100. Which of these numbers are prime? ans 13

Sally knows prime numbers only have one road. She says 11 is NOT prime because there are two roads: 5 + 6, 4 + 7. What is the mistake Sally made? 

More practice: 
Use passcode "PRIMES" at brooklynlearning.github.io/practice for more prime practice.




prime numbers are super important for passwords. Is 124238423849273498239123894723894232384923742398492342342423 a prime number?

There is only one way to check.







sally 1 is a prime number because there is only 1 road to 1: 1 * 1
tom 1 is not a prime number
sally but there is only one road
tom i know sally


whenever a number can't be broken into smaller numbers, we call it a prime number.



are there 2 numbers that can multiply together and make 5?
there certainly are: 1 times 5 is 5.
any more?
mmm, I think that's it.
When a number only has 2 numbers that can multiply to it, we call it a prime number. ------

For this question, (AB and BA are considered to be the same)

Sometimes, the order matters.
For pizza toppings, asking for A and then asking for B, is the same as asking for B and then A. At the end of the day, your pizza will have both toppings. The order here, doesnt matter.

Other times, order DOES matter.

I would like green peppers.

I think we should ask for pepperonis first.
Um guys? The order doesnt matter. Either way, the pizza will have pepperoni and green peppers.

How many gummy bears were originally in the bag?
How many gummy bears are left over?

See the quick answer
Read the Answer Explanation

kloe, how do you do this question?
we setup a proportion
because we know that sam eats 20% of the gummy bears
and we know sarah says that sam eats 30 gummy bears
that means 20% of the gummies equals 30
the proportion we are going to setup looks like this
@proportion 20% to 30 | 100% to x
why do you write 100%?
Because the first question wants "originally in the bag." Originally in the bag means before any of the gummies have been eaten. That would be all of them, also known as 100%.
Okay, so now we have this proportion. 
@prop
What do we do next?
How do you get from 20% to 100%?
Multiply by 5.
So that's what we do!
We multiply by 5?
Indeed we do. A very common pattern in math is if you do something to the left side, you do it to the right side. If you do something to the top, you do it to the bottom. If you do something to the first proportion, you do it to the second proportion.
30 * 5 = 150. #green Originally, there were 150 gummies.
And since Sam eats 30 of them, #green leftover are 150 - 30 = 120 gummies.

Sam has a bag of x gummy bears. He eats y% of them.
Sarah: "Sam! I can't believe you ate z gummy bears all at once!"

hint: This question is exactly like the previous question except the numbers have been changed to the variables x, y, and z. 

It is super important for SHSAT math to feel comfortable with variables.

Something that you can always do is plug in numbers for the variables. It makes the question much easier to think about.

How many gummy bears were originally in the bag?
x * 100 / y ans
y * 100 / x
x / y
x * 100 - y

How many gummy bears are left over?

x(y - 100) / y
y(x - 100) / x
x(y + 100) / y
y(x + 100) / x

Sam eats 20% of 100 gummy bears.
Sarah eats 20% of what's left over.
Tom eats 20% of what's left over after Sarah is finished.
How many gummies does Sam eat? 0.2 * 100
How many gummies does Sarah eat? 0.8 * 100 * 0.2
How many gummies does Tom eat? 0.8 * 100 * 0.8 * 0.2
How many gummies are left over? 
What percentage of the original number of gummies does Sam eat?
What percentage of the original number of gummies does Sarah eat?
What percentage of the original number of gummies does Tom eat?

Sam increases a number by 10%.
And then decreases the new number by 20%.

#primeFactorization
prime factorization means take a number and break it down completely into prime numbers.
please show me an example kaylee
:sure, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 * 2 * 3.
notice how 2 * 2 * 3 = 12
also notice how 2, 2, and 3, are all prime numbers.
that's how you know you did it corectly

can you do 2 * 6? 2 * 6 = 12
you cant because 6 is not a prime number

a useful strat for doing pf is to divide the number by 2 if it is even
and if the number is odd, try to divide it by 3, 5, 7, or 11.
guys, let's do the pf for 100.
100 is an even number. divide it by 2. | 100 = 2 * 50
50 is still an even number. divide it by 2 again. | 100 = 2 * 2 * 25
25 can be divided by 5 | 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
Now what do we do?
We're done! 2, 2, 5, and 5 are all prime numbers. The pf of 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
let's find the pf for 1024.'
that is a huge number1
we're going to do great
1024 is even. divide it by 2. | 1024 = 2 * 512
512 is even. divide it by 2. | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 256
256 / 2 equals 128 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 128
128 / 2 equals 64 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 64
Guys ... are we there yet?
We can still keep going!
64 / 2 equals 32 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 32
32 / 2 equals 16 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 16
16 / 2 equals 8 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 8
help! This is too much!
8 / 2 equals 4 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 4
4 / 2 equals 2 | 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

The final answer for the pf of 1024 is 2 times itself 10 times.
I never want to do this again!
Then memorize this next trick.
If I memorize it will I never have to do this again?
Maybe.
Fine, Ill memorize it.
What is the pf of 2048?
Nooooooo! We have to do that whole thing again. Divide and divide and divide forever.
The trick is we can skip a lot of steps.
How?
Because you already know that 1024 is 2 times itself 10 times.
But this number isnt 1024. This number is 2048.
But look! 2048 = 2 * 1024

:hmm ... 1024 is 2 times itself 10 times.
2048 ... has an extra 2.
Does that means 2048 is going to be 2 times itself 11 times?

You did it Kloe!
No. We did it. All of us, together.
Great work everyone!

Narrator: Kloe, Kaylee, and Elina looked at each other and smiled. Finding the pf of 1024 and 2048 was a great accomplishment. The three young math students walked off into the sunset. It was time to go eat ice cream.

2^0 which is 1
2^1 which is 2
2^2 which is 4
2^3 which is 8

The factors for 2^4 (also known as 16) are:
2^0 which is 1

Help Notes


You can write it like this: 1024 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
Or you can write it like this: 1024 = 2^10

Writing it the second way is called exponential form. The little 10 means you're multiply the 2 by itself 10 times. ------



/home/kdog3682/CWF/public/m2.txt------ Anytime you want to make a math question harder,
All you have to do is add some decimals and fractions.

That's why math teachers always say, "make the question easier for yourself. Try to get rid of the decimals and fractions."

There is a very popular way of getting rid of fractions called "cross-multiply."

x/3 = y/4
Kind of scary right? Now
Any time you have fractions on both sides of an equal sign, you can do cross-multiplication.

# SolvingForX

Solving for x,
also known as "find x",
is a really popular type of math question.
It usually starts showing up around 5th or 6th grade.

The easy way of doing "solve for x" is to keep guessing a number.

x + 3 = 5.
Let me guess that x equals 1.
Im sorry kloe. 1 + 3 does not equal 5.
Fine. Next I will guess that x = 2.
Wonderful kloe! 2 + 3 does indeed equal 5. Your answer is correct.

3x = 12.
Guess x = 1. 3 * 1 = 3.
Guess x = 2. 3 * 2 = 6.
Guess x = 3. 3 * 3 = 9.
Guess x = 4. 3 * 4 = 12. ANSWER!

This "guess and check" method will always work. It is something you can always do when you want to check your answer.

But.

But for harder questions, it is slow.
For harder questions, there are a set of rules to follow. By following these rules, you will always end up with the right answer.

Who invented these rules?
A mathematician named John. He was born in the year 453.


Rule #1 - Combine X's together. Combine numbers together.

x + x + x + x - 2 = 5 + 10 + 15
Reminder: x is the same as "1x"
Combine the X's together means to add together all the x's. 

1x + 1x + 1x + 1x = 4x

Combine the numbers together | 5 + 10 + 15 = 30

What we have now is this | 4x - 2 = 30


Rule #2 - Move the x's to one side. Move the numbers to the other side.

All of the x's are already on the left side. We can just leave it as it is.

But for the numbers, there is a 2 on the left side, and a 30 on the right side. We need to move the 2 to the right side.

How do we do that?
By doing the opposite.
Opposite?
kloe, do you see how it says "-2" ?
Yes
The opposite of -2 is plus 2. We are going to plus 2 to both sides.
-2 plus 2 cancels into zero.
30 + 2 = 32
We are almost at the end. What we currently have is | 4x = 32

Rule #3 - Get x by itself by doing the opposite.

Didnt we kind of just do that? 
We certainly did. The idea of "doing the opposite" happens a lot in math. 

Right now it says "4x".
We dont want 4x. We are solving for x. We want x.
How do we get rid of the 4?
By doing the opposite.
Remember guys, there is an invisible multiplication sign between the 4 and the x. 4x actually means 4 times x.
The opposite of times is divide.
Does that mean we divide by 4?
Exactly kloe. 4 / 4 will cancel into 1.
We now have 1x = 32
1x is the same as x. We now have x = 32.
But the most important part: anything you do to the left side, you have do to the other side.
Since we divided the left side by 4,
we also have to divide the right side by 4.
32 / 4 = 8
We now have our final answer.
Guys we found x!
x = 8

To make sure that x = 8 is the correct answer, plug it back into the original question.

Original Question: x + x + x + x - 2 = 5 + 10 + 15

8 + 8 + 8 + 8 - 2 = 5 + 10 + 15

It matches! x = 8 is absolutely the correct answer.

Review of the Rules: 

Rule #1 - Combine X's together. Combine numbers together.
Rule #2 - Move the x's to one side. Move the numbers to the other side.
Rule #3 - Get x by itself by doing the opposite.

Question: x + x - 2 - 3 = 7

First, combine x's together and combine numbers together.
x + x = 2x
-2 - 3 = -5
2x - 5 = 7

Move the -5 to the other side by adding 5 to both sides.
-5 + 5 = 0
7 + 5 = 12
2x = 12

Get rid of the 2 by dividing by 2.
Which means dividing by 2 on the other side as well.
2/2 cancels into 1
12/2 equals 6
The final answer is x = 6.

Check the answer by plugging in 6.
Original Question: x + x - 2 - 3 = 7
6 + 6 - 2 - 3 = 7 ... it works!

1x + 2x + 3x + 4 + 5 = 6 + 7 + 8

1x + 2x

Like terms means you can add apples together.
You can add bananas together.
But you CANNOT add apples and bananas together.

2 apples + 3 apples = 
2 bananas + 3 bananas =
2 apples + 3 bananas =

? + 3a = 5a

That means m would have to equal 2.
Hmm. n = 3. m = 2. n is bigger.

Exponent Rule #2: 
2^3 * 2^4 = 2^7 because 3 + 4 = 7
x^10 * x^20 = x^30 because 10 + 20 = $input

x^1 * x^2 * x^3 * x^4 * x^5 = $input
x^1 * $input * x^3 * x^4 * x^5 = x^100
100^100 * 100^99 = x^198 * 100^y. x + y = ?


Exponent Rule #3: 

2^3^4 = 2^12 because 3 * 4 = 12
2^3^4^5 = 2^60 because 3 * 4 * 5 = $input

Exponent Rule #3: (very similar to Rule #2)
2^(20) = 2^(4 * 5) because 4 * 5 = 20

2^(4 * 5) = 2^4^5 = 2^20 because 4 * 5 = 20
2^(xy) = 2^x^y because x * y = xy
2^(x/3) = 2^x^1/3 because x * $input = x/3



Exponent Rule #3: 

Remember to distribute

(2x)^2 = ? 

Common mistake: Students forget to do 2^2.

Wrong answer: 2x^2
Right answer: 4x^2

(abc)^2 = 
xxx^2 = 
(xxx)^2 = 
(abc)^2 = xa^2. x = ?

#handshakes

Anna and Bob shake hands.
AB = 1 handshake because AB and BA are the same thing.
Total handshakes = 1

Anna, Bob, Carla all shake hands.
The handshakes are:
AB, AC, BC
Total handshakes = 3

Anna, Bob, Carla, David all shake hands.
The unique handshakes are:
AB, AC, AD
BC, BD
CD
Total handshakes = 6

How many unique handshakes are there for: 
5 people?
6 people?
7 people?

Look for a pattern. How many unique handshakes are there for 100 people?




#lineIntersections

2 lines intersect | lineIntersection(2)
The maximum number of intersections is 1.

3 lines intersect | lineIntersection(3)
The maximum number of intersections is 3.

4 lines intersect | | lineIntersection(4) 
The maximum number of intersections is 6.

Doesn't this look just like the handshake question?
How many possible intersections are there for:
5 lines?
6 lines?
7 lines?

Sam flips a coin. Heads or Tails.

Ms. Chung picks a student name randomly out of a hat. Her class has 3 students. After picking the name, she reads it outloud, and then puts the name back into the hat. Then, Ms. Chung picks another name. What is the probability that the first name and the second name are the SAME name?

Anna says, "Lets pretend the names are A, B, C. The chance of picking A on the first try is 1/3. The chance of picking A again on the second try is 1/3. I think the answer will be 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9."

Bob: I kind of agree with you Anna. But I think you should do 1/9 times 3 because there are 3 students. I think the final answer should be 1/3.

Q1: Ms. Chung has 5 letters, A, B, C, D, E. She picks two of them at random. What is the probability that the 2 letters she picks are adjacent to each other?


Q2: Ms. Chung has 5 letters in a hat, A, B, C, D, E. She picks one letter at random out of the hat. Then, she picks another one. What is the probability that the 2 letters she picks are adjacent to each other?

Creative thinking.

note: the word adjacent means right next to. For example, 1 is adjacent to 2. X is adjacent to Y. 1 is NOT adjacent to 100 because 1 and 100 are not right next to each other.

Pretend the first letter Ms. Chung picks is A. 
There is a 1/5 chance of picking A.
That means the next letter has to be a B.
There is a 1/4 chance of picking B.

So the chance of p

#substitution require(exponents, factoring)

Crucial to mathematics is knowing when to transform one expression into another equivalent expression. Instead of 6, we could write 7 - 1. 6 and 7 - 1 have the same value: They both equal 6. But sometimes, it may be more useful to have 7 - 1.

We first learn about this idea of equivalent expressions in elementary school. 2/3 + 1/6. The teacher says, "You need a common denominator!" Students learn that they can transform 2/3 into 4/6. 2/3 and 4/6 are exactly the same. But in this situation, it is more useful to have 4/6.


Substitution is one of the most powerful and commonly used types of mathematical transformation. Whenever you can, look for opportunities to substitute. It will ALWAYS simplify the question.

(x + 3) / (x + 3) = ?

Well duh. The top is (x + 3) and the bottom is (x + 3). The top and bottom are the same. This will cancel into 1.

But what you could do, if you wanted to, is set up a substitution.

let u = x + 3
This will transform the question into u/u
u/u clearly equals 1.

note: The letter "u" was used here as the substitution variable. You can choose any letter that you like. But "u" is commonly used.

What just happened? Essentially, we created a new variable "u" out of nothing. This question is simple enough, that you dont really need to substitute. However for harder questions, it can often be usefull.

(x + 3)^2 + 5(x + 3) + 6 = 0

First we do it without substitution:

@numbered
Distribute the first part into: x^2 + 6x + 9
Distribute the second part into: 5x + 15
Add on the ending 6
Add it all up: x^2 + 11x + 30 
Factor it ... (x + 5)(x + 6) = 0
The answer is x = -5, or x = -6.

There is nothing wrong with doing it like this. The answer is completely correct. But by using a substitution, you can get the answer a little bit faster.

Original Question: (x + 3)^2 + 5(x + 3) + 6 = 0

@numbered
the substitution we will use is u = x + 3
The question transforms into: u^2 + 5u + 6 = 0
Factor it: (u + 2)(u + 3) = 0
Put the x + 3 back in for u. 
  (x + 3 + 2)(x + 3 + 3) = 0
  (x + 5)(x + 6) = 0
The answer is x = -5, or x = -6.

#example
2(x - 7) = 46 + y
x - 7 = 25
Find y

It is tempting to start doing math as fast as you can. Distribute the 2 and the (x - 7). Add some stuff together. Subtract. Get y by itself. Get the answer.

Or, just look at the question. See that you can do a direct substitution. x - 7 = 25. So just plug that value right in. 2(x - 7) will be 2 * 25 which equals 50. 50 = 46 + y ... y equals 4.


#example
x^3 = 8
x^9 = ?

Slow way: x^3 = x * x * x = 8. That means x = 2. 2^9 equals 512.
Fast way: x^9 = x^3 * x^3 * x^3. Direct substitution: x^3 = 8. x^9 = 8 * 8 * 8 = 512.


#example
x^2/3 + 5x^1/3 + 6 = 0

For this example, you actually have to use substitution. There is no other way to solve it.

The substitution will be u = x^1/3
This transforms the question into:
u^2 + 5u + 6 = 0
(u + 2)(u + 3) = 0
u = -2
u = -3
Plug the x^1/3 back in. (this was the original substitution)
x^1/3 = -2
x = -8

x^1/3 = -3
x = -27
The final answer is x = -8 and x = -27.









Math is a language.
In spanish class, students memorize vocabulary words.
In math class, students memorize graphs.

Right now, it is not important whether or not it makes sense.
Just memorize it. Later, it will make sense.

Graph #1

f(x) = sin(x)

The most important thing to remember about sin(x) is that sin(0) = 1. sin(0) equals 1 means, when you plug in x = 0, the value that comes out is 1. 


f(x) = cos(x)

cos(x) and sin(x) are brothers and kind of opposites. cos(0) = 0.

It is super important to memorize that sin(0) = 1 and cos(0) = 0.

One way to remember it is that the "i" in sin kind of looks like a "1" and the "o" in cos kind of looks like a "0".

f(x) = tan(x)

It is quite strange, but it turns out sin divided by cos equals tan! This was discovered by a dude named Hipparchus in the year 120BC.

We know sin(0) = 1
We know cos(0) = 0
We know sin / cos = tan
That means tan(0) = sin(0) / cos(0) or 1 / 0
The most important thing to know about tan is that tan(0) is undefined because 1/0 is undefined.


f(x) = e^x

e^x is perhaps the most fascinating graph of all time. It has one special property that no other graph has. A large part of calculus class is focused on investigating the super interesting features of e^x.
