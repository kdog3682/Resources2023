Introduction
----------------

There are many many languages in the world of programming.

----------------
Python is often used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    OpenAI uses python to create the neural nets which result in ChatGPT.

----------------
C++ is strong for robotics and engineering.
    The flight software of SpaceX is written in c++.

----------------
Scala is a favorite for backend servers.
    Millions of chess games are played every day on lichess.org.
    Lichess uses scala to manage this feat.

----------------


The language that we will start with is Javascript.

Javascript is the language of websites.
Online games, pictures, animations, chat messages: all of this is done through javascript.

----------------



Javascript and the DOM
----------------

DOM stands for "document object model".

Think of the DOM as a tree.
A tree begins with a root.

The root branches off into a trunk.
The trunk branches off into branches.
The branches might branch into more branches.
Eventually, the branches branch into leaves.

@float

sample DOM for an apple tree

    root
        trunk              
            branch A    
                apple
                apple
            branch B      
                apple
                branch C 
                    apple
                    apple
                    apple

----------------

The power of javascript is that it can control the DOM.

    Control it.
    Create it.
    Change it.

JS is the DOM controller.

----------------

We are going to use javascript to build a simple website.

    A blue circle with the word "Hello".
    A red square with the word "World".

----------------

Step 1: Initialize the document object.

const html = new DOMNode('root') 
const body = html.appendChild('body')

@float

root
    body <-- We are Here

----------------

@sidenote
In chemistry, atoms form molecules which form everything else.
In coding, nodes form branches, and branches form trees.

The body is the main container for everything that happens on a webpage.
It is the canvas upon which the artist may draw.

Now that we have the body, we can start drawing.
----------------
First we create the blue circle.
    
    const sam = body.appendChild('sam')

----------------

We want a blue circle.

    sam.style.shape = 'circle'
    sam.style.background = 'blue'

----------------
The size of a circle is defined by a radius.
Sam needs a radius.

    sam.style.radius = 25

----------------
Finally, we want the circle to say "hello"

    sam.textContent = "hello"

----------------
Success!
We have a blue circle with the words hello.
----------------

Here is the javascript code to make a red square with the word "world"

    const ham = body.appendChild('ham')
    ham.style.background = "red"
    ham.style.width = 50
    ham.style.height = 50
    ham.textContent = "world"

----------------

$, do you need to write ham.style.shape = "square" ?

----------------

Not in this case because the default shape of a document element (aka document node) is a rectangle.

By setting ham's width and height to both be 50,
ham automatically takes on the shape of a square.

----------------

Here is the final result of our blue circle red square website.

columns
    
    Javascript Code
    @getJavascript(all)

    Model Representation
    @toModel($js)

    Website Output
    @toHTML($js)

----------------

Right now, the website looks a little plain.
Part of our homework assignment is to add more styles.

----------------

We can add more styles like this:

    ham.style.color = 'white'
    ham.style.fontWeight = 'bold'
    ham.style.textAlign = 'center'


----------------

We can also create animated effects:

ham.animate('color', 'white', 'blue', 3)

This will make Ham's color change from white to blue over 3 seconds.

ham.animate('fontSize', 10, 16, 5)

This will make Ham's font size go from 10 to 16 over 5 seconds.

# Review Notes

Use element.style.something to change an element's style.

The dom is a tree of elements. 
Elements have children.
Elements have parents and siblings.

The root element, also called the root node, is analogous to the seed of a tree. Everything starts at the root node.

Every webpage begins with:

    const html = new DOMNode('root') 
    const body = html.appendChild('body')

The html root represents the seed of the tree.
The body represents the trunk of the tree.
The body is where everything happens.


Every webpage begins with:

    const html = new DomNode('root') 
    const body = html.appendChild('body')

This is actually NOT true.
We will talk more about this later after we have learned some React, Vue, and libraries.

Coding Internship

Facebook, Google all have 

Sometimes internships are paid.
Sometimes they aren't.

Unpaid Internships

Ugh. Who wants to do free work right?

Another way to think about it is:

    An internship is a chance to meet fellow peers.
    An internship is a chance to develop new skills and strengthen existing skills.
    An internship is a chance to discover and learn.

    Unpaid internships often lead to financial opportunities.
    Your employer may really like you and
    Your employer may feel grateful that you are doing free work and hence write you a strong recommendation or reference letter

Response: 






























In the introduction,

You were introduced to 4 big programming languages.

python
C++
scala
javascript

There's more.

java (android and google)
rust (facebook)
SQL  (servers)


The reason we are starting with javascript is because it has a built-in purpose: making websites.

The key to learning code is to have a strong purpose.
90% of an iceberg is beneath water.

To truly go deep into python, to truly go deep into any coding language, you need a purpose.
Otherwise, you will just float on the surface. 

For now, you will follow my plans, and borrow "my purpose."
Here's some of the stuff we are going to make: 

But actively,
You must think of a personal purpose.

Examples:
Grant Sanderson wanted to make math videos.
He went deep into python to achieve this purpose.
See his videos here.

Personal Example:
I want to make fun learning activities and learning materials.
I went deep into javascript to achieve this purpose.

Will you be able to come up with a million dollar idea?

Maybe. But for right now, that's not the point.

The point right now is to accumulate extraordinary skills.
Having a strong purpose for coding helps you achieve this goal.


Maybe you like to play chess.
What is a tool that you could make to facilitate

Maybe you like 

Make it something personal.

Something that directly impacts you.
Something that helps your family.
Something that saves you a few minutes of time.
Something that you think ise useful.
Something that  you think would be fun.

A meaningful personal project is something you will be excited to talk about. This excitement and passion has very many positive butterfly effects.

Think about your daily routine.
Think about something that you do more

Kids need a feeling of love.


Anything is possible.

Once you have an idea for a personal project,


Keeping Your Personal Project Private

Maybe you are afraid someone will copy and steal your work.
Maybe you feel embarrassed by it.

These are very valid feelings.
You can absolutely keep your work private.

But also, keep in mind the big picture.
The goal of high school is to charge up lots of power.
Unleash this power in college and beyond.

By showing other people your project,
Maybe they will give you suggestions.
Maybe it will make you feel competitive which will in turn 









Case 1: You are a coding genius and someone copies your work:
    That sucks for you.

Case 2: You are not a coding genius and someone copies your work:
    It doesn't really matter.




























Do I think javascript is the best language?
Not at all. I think many of you are going to really like python and scala.

But these languages require a purpose.
In fact








you can instantly see results.

You can write some code in class.
Take it home.
Put it on your computer.

And it will work.

This is not as true for the other languages.










It is possible that you may not want to do

Practice Questions

Use the following code snippet to answer questions 1 to 10.


const html = new DOMNode('root')
const body = html.appendChild('body')

const A = body.appendChild('A')
const B = body.appendChild('B')
const C = body.appendChild('C')
const D = C.appendChild('D')
const E = C.appendChild('E')
const F = C.appendChild('F')
const G = B.appendChild('G')


----------------

How many children does the body object have?
Phrased as code: What does body.children.length equal?

0 1 2 3 4

----------------


Do A and B have the same number of children?

Yes because A.length == B.length
No because A.length == 1 and B.length == 0
Yes because A.length == B.length
No because A.children.length == 0 and B.children.length == 1

if (1 + 2 == 3) {
    return 'X'
} else {
    return 'Y'
}

What is the return value of this statement?


Who is the first child of html?
A
body
B
html

Who is the last child of body?
A
B
C
D


if (g.children.length > 1) {
    return 'great'
} else {
    return g.appendChild('H')
}

What does the above expression return?

It returns a word
It returns a number
It returns a new document object
It returns nothing

A.style.x = 50
A.style.y = 50

Write style coordinates for B so that it is located 100 away from A.

B.style.x = 
B.style.y = 

Write the following statement as code.
if A has more children than B, set A's color to orange.
Otherwise, set B's color to green.


Who does root.firstChild.firstChild.firstChild equal?
    In other words,
    

A
B
C
D

What will be the results following this statement?

if (root.firstChild.firstChild.length < A.firstChild.length) {
    body.firstChild.lastChild.style.shape = 'triangle'
}
else if (1 == 2) {
    A.style.background == 'green'
}

else if (D.children.length == 2) {
    D.style.background == 'yellow'
}
else {
    B.style.background == 'blue'
}


A will turn green
B will become blue
C will become a triangle
D will become yellow


True or False: body.children.length == C.children.length

if (body.children.length == C.children.length) {
    return 'abc'
} else {
    
}

if (G.children.length == F.children.length) {
    
}
