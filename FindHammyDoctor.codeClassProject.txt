Sammy and Hammy have been busy baking and eating cakes.

Here is what Hammy wants.

Step 1.

Ham wants a json file containing every single doctor at Maimonides along with their information.

The json file should look like this:

maimonides-doctors.json:

    [
        {
            fullName: 'John Bob',
            aboutMe: '',
            education: {
                undergraduate: ['university of ham'],
                postgraduate: ['university of ham'],
            },
            expertise: [
                /* list of expertises */
            ],
            acceptsInsuranceFrom: [
                /* list of accepted insurances */
            ],
            telephone: '123-456-7890',
            address: '1234 hammy town'
        },
        { name: 'Tom Walker', /* more data */ },
        { name: 'Tom Walker', /* more data */ },
        { name: 'Tom Walker', /* more data */ },
        { name: 'Tom Walker', /* more data */ },
    ]

The creation of this json file is the data-collection process.

You will need to write a program that can generate this json file.

Notes:

This challenge mode ... is way too hard.
Challenge Mode:

When you visit anyone of the doctor's page, you will notice it does not give the doctor's age. You will not find the doctor's age anywhere on the page. Therefore, the challenge is to also include the doctor's age into your data collection.

To do this, you will need to go beyond Maimonides and into google. You have the doctor's name, you have lots of information. It is possible to piece this together to potentially find additional information about the doctor.

Maybe the doctor uses linkedin.
On linkedin, it will maybe say the doctor graduated college in 2012.
Once you have that, 

Option 2:

Maybe the doctor has a personal website.
Maybe on July 3rd, 2022, the doctor made a website talking about a 3 year old son.
