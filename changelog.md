Is there a Debugging Environment for Writing Chrome Extensions?

Presently, my workflow is 

    1. Make an edit in service-worker.js
    2. Click over to chrome://extensions
        Remove the current extension
        Unpack the extension again
    3. Refresh browser --> navigate to a website
    4. Watch the extension run and check the console

An ideal workflow would be something like:

    1. Make an edit
    2. Refresh --> see the effect

Do you guys have any suggestions on what I could try?

A game filled with chaos.

Teaching Advice

When you yell at young students to do something, after a while, they stop listening. The more you yell, the less powerful your yell becomes.


Young students may make you feel annoyed.

"Why are you being so annoying?"
"Stop that. Stop that right now."

Kids are not annoying on purpose.
They are always annoying for a reason.

    - They are hungry, tired, or hot
    - The activity is too easy or too hard
    - They're bored
    - They think the teacher is bossy
    - You remind them of someone they don't like

A solution that always works is forcefulness.

Stop right now.
Go take a time out.
If you dont behave, I will call your parents. You will be in trouble.

This is the hammer solution.

Those who will read it.
And those who wont.

No favorites

Children can sense when their teacher or guardian has favorites. This creates invisible tension between the favored group and the regular group.


Human nature is to have favorites.
As a teacher, treat all of your students equally.


Every Day is a New Day

Every day, give the student the benefit of the doubt.
The student didn't turn in homework 9 days in a row.
Believe in him. Believe today is the day.


Containers

Children are like water. They flow to the container they're given.
Children hate the container. They want to go outwards.
Children love the container. Structure makes them feel safe.

Your students must respect you.
Without respect, there is no container.
Respect is the foundation of learning.


Your Students Will Copy You

What is your favorite part about who you are?

Write 2 paragraphs.
Use concrete details.


This is a pretty hard question.
The answer you give today might be very different from the answer you give in 10 years, or 20 years.

The reason for this essay question is Your Students Will Copy You.
children are sponges and they will latch on. Your favorite part of yourself, is something the students will copy it.

Are you competitive? Your students will slowly become competitive.
Are you easygoing? Your students will slowly become easygoing.

Children will follow your energy.


Creative
Courageous
Confident
Careful
Cool
Caring
Diligent

If you can't think of anything, choose a trait from the above list. Write 2 paragraphs about how you can be a role model and demonstrate this trait to your students.

They will respond to a female

    class is harder to debug (lots of implicits)
    Composition is messier (lots of text, lots of argument passing)
    Composition is more flexible (dont need to bind anything)

07-27-2023 Preventing Negative Situations case-study: Kevin & WeiShao

triggers
    WeiShao to Kevin: 
        advice on how to play defense
        kevin didnt really listen
    WeiShao to Group: 
        while talking in the group, kevin didnt have much to say
        WeiShao gets impression of kevin's poor chinese
    Kevin to WeiShao:
        what is your name?
        WeiShao responds "you can just call me X"
        kevin doesnt like the dismissive tone
blowup
    Playing together, Weishao repeatedly gives instructions
    Kevin starts completing ignoring the instructions
    Kevin starts doing the opposite
    After the game, kevin gets in Weishao's face confrontationally

aftereffects
    can pretty accurately say k & w no longer like playing together
    k and w try to avoid each other's playing times

analysis
    There were 2 major pre-triggers for the brewing storm
    There were multiple warning signs

future preventions
    dont play 3 vs. 3
    dont use whiny voice when someone
    be extra careful once there are 2 triggers
        xingge
        alan
        chenfen

    be extra careful in general
    no blowups allowed
    when you have a shot, you need to shoot it
        take your time and shoot it with form



further
    sometimes triggers can be reset
    usually the reset happens if you understand where they're coming from

    once a blowup happens, the glass breaks
    it takes a considerable amount of effort to undo the break
    it is like putting shards of glass back together
    family can undo blowups
    but rarely can strangers do it
    maybe siblings can undo it

    //they wont want to play with you

    Unless you understand them, and know where they are coming from, pople usually wont do something

Do I need a deep and manly voice?

No you dont

Do I need to pretend to be an adult?

no you dont
Young children can smell fakers.

do i need to make a conscious effort to be mature?
yes you do

being mature is like being confident

When things are going well, it comes naturally.
When things are not going well, you have to put energy in to make it happen. 

sometimes you will forget to be mature. You fall off the horse. Get back on the horse. Keep going. From age 15 to age 50, we fall off the horse. We get back on the horse. Year after year, we become more and more mature. Make mistakes. Learn from them. Try not to make the same mistake.

In anime, lots of characters have special abilities.
Special abilities are real. People in real life have them.
From age 20 to age 30, is when most people discover their abilities.

Stephen Curry was 26 years old, when he can shoot from infinite range.
Stephen Curry was always a good shooter.
But it was only in 2016 that he entered the next level of confidence.

The goal 

3rd and 4th graders are 8 and 9 years old.
You are 15 16 17 18 years old.
When you are 30

What's your special ability?

Don't have one?
Nonsense.
Anyone who wants one. Has one.
The seed is burried deep inside of you.

It is way too abstract.

The American phenotype is not super easy to assimilate.

Children are your ultimate legacy.
They are your blood, and your inheritance.

On the one hand, the kids are wild.
On the other hand, wild energy is still energy.

Boys, you are playing basketball like headless chickens.

@Wei
    When you shoot the ball,
    You have to believe the ball is going in.

    Some players are good at shooting.
    It is easy for them to believe.

    Basketball is just a game.
    But it is also a metaphor for life.

    Test scores, personal goals, difficult tasks,
    They all require the same mental discipline as shooting a basketball.

        The mental discipline of believing in yourself.
            Not surface level words
            But really deep in your heart
        The mental discipline of focusing in the moment.
            "being in the zone"
            "being locked in"
        The mental discipline of staying even-keeled
            not too high when you win
            not too low when you lose

@Evan

    An okay shooter can be a good passer. (me)
    A good shooter can be a great passer. (you)

    You do 3 things:
    See the entire court.
    Basketball is a game of flow

Hey Kevin

The disadvantages need to be barred at the door
And not leak over
Mom can never be blamed

This achieves the effect, but it is not the correct way to achieve it.

Making errant passes to Sammy

    the boys feel isolated - no one talked to them
New: Lucas & Richard
The feeling state ... it is the state which guides all of us. but especially children. they feel the feelings on a much deeper level. 

No one wants to feel small.
Playing with kids is has always been important to me.
My actions inadverdently cause feelings of smallness.

Saying no will always be the first reaction

Getting into an argument with a kid
To gauge the feelings

To make mistakes ... and then to try and fix them.
Nothing of an organized nature. 

Chinese Class
Bu yao qu tai yang li mian

Never offer things.
A team takes time to form and build trust.
Spinning a basketball takes active practice.

Teenagers are still too young... 
Teenagers are practically kids themselves.

A few years, makes quite the difference.

You forget.
You fall into certain bad habits.

You forget to give the feelings.
It is a lot to balance.

Lea
The feeling of not being scared to go against someone older.
Whether Evan plays or not is none of my business. It is their business.
Librarians are care takers of the library. The chidlren need to band together. You cannot interfere or meddle in their affairs. You can stack the odds. You can create opportunities. But you cannot meddle. 
To ask for forgiveness after.

The pressure of being in charge is a lot.
A perpetual down feeling... 

The kids dont feel it consciously.
But they feel it deeply.

Steps

1. Apply
2. Practice your reading voice.
3. Volunteer
4. Food

The most important quality for teaching young kids is cheering for them. Being smart is a little important. Cheering is super important.

Cheering doesnt have to be loud like, "Oh yeah!!!" Or "Great Job!!!"
The most important part about cheering is showing the kids that you are genuinely happy for their success. Loud or quiet, gentle or intense, it all comes from your heart.

The feeling of taking a wrong turn.

How you see yourself leads to how you act.
Dress professional leads to acting professional.

The students are told to call you mister and miss.

Periodically, I will interrupt and say something.
I will correct you.
I hope you will not take it personally.

Take it more seriously.

You are not making money from this.
but what I can deeply promise you, 

The ability of maturity and responsibility is extremely valuable.
Practice it.

Purpose

Young elementary students love having role-models.
To a 4th grader, high schoolers are the coolest people in the world.
4th and 5th graders want to look up to you.

High school students can fulfill school volunteer requirements.
High schoolers can build strong resumes for college applications.
High schoolers can practice leadership, maturity, and responsibility.

The Giving Rules

As an adult, we feel much different.
The feeling in the brain is different. 

We texted for about 15 minutes. And then it ended.

the price is 25 a month.
there is no shield of armor
To choose.
To make a decision...
Nothing is more fun than that... 

Ive always wanted to try this place.
It is a different feeling.

A system. 
And I completely forgot about it afterwards.
It wasn't on my mind.
I teach elementary school math.

To check up on it. After 3 or 4 hours. The strength of children ... 
Call on Saturday.

The armor not present.
Playing with the kids, 
My spirit starts to flow.
It flows into the kids, who retain the memory.
Again, and again, and again: the spirit starts to flow.

Dap them up.
To back up the kids.

No labels

To play with the kids ... has always been super important to me.
Because if I play, then they will remember. Right now, my dreams cannot be accomplished in words. What you get, is what you give. 
why is this helping so important to me? the path towards healing is helping. ensuring that others do not suffer a similar fate. my fate? i am healing myself. the selfishness cannot be seen when zoomed in. 

A young girl. 
Dessert. My favorite.
Very formal.

To come a vacation in NY.
I dont remember anymore.
Maybe something happened awhile ago.
Trying again after 4 years.

Responding to text messages.
The children think they can win against me which is the crucial element. The children are able to infer the intent of the watcher. A bigger lion playing with a young cub. Practical improvement. To harness the power of a name.

The world that I want to see is one with pockets of power.

I will not promise anything.
No hugs.
The last time I posted.
You have a family. I can't possibly ask. 
How much of you is still Lisa?
How much of you is a mom?

Bobby

I miss all of them. It was such a fun group of guys. I learned so much about them. It's kind of far. Seeing a sister. To treat them all equally.
Bu-neng. A feeling of power. To ask. Where a person is? To remember these feelings of weakness? To spread some happiness. To respond. Like Christina Nguyen. 

My stories.  

I saw Jayson last year. 

There are many things that you cannot predict.
Many things that can go wrong.
Many things that ... 

Nothing to prove.

No promises.
I teach  math.

I teach elementary school math.













Responding super slow.

Lucky to meet someone.


To have a relationship would be nice.
To not have a relationship, there are other relationships.
Keep it on silent.
To grow up here.

The name of the teacher is not there.
To see the alternative points of view.

The lives that people live.
The words that 

When you want to hang out, 
Christina, ... seamlessness

The lives coming together

Connecting 2 of her friends together.
To look back on what happened before. To glue the details together. No.
Whatever happened before, happened.
To instantly and easily play with the kids.

It's the situation which makes it weird.

I just want to be friends.
The feeling that emanates is an interesting one.

New Jersey and DC. 

Vietnamese. Chinese. Korean. Japanese. 
Monoculture is incorrect.
Learning something.
They managed to survive. And become something.

To accept the things that are.




Jaylen Brunson plays for the team.
To support the next generation.
Friends playing with each other.
The preventing of catastrophe

My spirit animal is the turtle.

Patience
Longevity
Protective
Wisdom
Perseverance
Nurturing

But that is just one part of it.
To see Melia again in another form.

Often, other people can see things clearer than ourselves.
Setting up some teaching stuff.

It takes time to connect.

Getting things ready for elementary math and middle school math.
The SHSAT...

It's not black and white. And that's how things are often painted. It's not working or not working.

Sunny. Lychee. 
It is fun.

Teaching stuff.
To be focused on it, and not distracted.

Personal happiness.
To talk about the things that I want to talk about. 

Met many friends here.
It feels so interesting that this place where Ive been living is the place where Jason grew up. 

To not ask the uncomfortable questions.
To not judge you on a score or a job. 

Secret advantages. The feelings you give. 

1 hour or 2 hours. I dont really want to talk about it. Elementary school math. Is like a mystery novel. 

To be snapped back into reality.

Things can change on a whim.
Not like you can say no.
That the feeling is different.

To put my dreams out there willy nilly.

Rules on what you can and cant do.
To not change the status quo. 

To consider the other way a little more.

Evan. We can make a handshake.

Good thinking Jason. I've never been here. 

The combined effect came out to be a good one. 
That's why it can't just be one person's thinking.
Because ultimately, one person makes mistakes.
A group consensus is almost always more well-rounded.
Or one aspect dominates.

That is where he lives.

To be excited.




Draw upon a reservoir.
Wrong.
The stable place is in doors.
The comprehension.
The secrets. I will copy the feeling. 

I didn't get much work done.
This is my dinner.
Okay.

To do what is right for me. I liked Bobby a lot.
when I keep score, I usually only count the good experiences.
To speak truthfully, and not pretend.

To just be me

Becky, Lisa, you guys are going to be my first customers.

Phoebe and Isiah are enrolled in Pre-K Reading 1.

Pre-K Reading 1 is 

    "Read with me Mom" Learning Series.
    "Read with me Dad" Learning Series.

Here are 2 samples

    For Lisa: Phoebe with Mom
    For Beck: Isiah with Dad


Letter of Introduction

Dear Parent,

In this introductory letter, I will be giving you instructions.

I do not know who you are.
I do not know who your child is.
What right do I possibly have, to give you instruction?

I have none.
I hope you will read these instructions. Take what you think is useful. Adapt my system, to fit you, and to fit your child.

In my classroom, these are the instructions that I follow.
These are the instructions I give high-schoolers when they work with young ones.

From the bottom of my heart, I have seen great results.

1. Find the Silver Lining

    
1. 


1. Only keep positive score

    Ivy is doing math flash cards.

    Sam is trying to read a paragraph perfectly.
    But he keeps getting a word here or there wrong.
    It's close. But not there.

1. React to Cheating with Kindness

    Children cheat or copy because they're scared.
    They're scared of making the same mistake.
    They're scared of feeling dumb.


1. Goofing off is okay




1. Let the student eat his or her own accomplishment.

    After struggling, for awhile, Shujing finally understands division.
    The teacher stands up and says, "What a great teacher I am!"

    Let Shujing eat her own accomplishment.
    Hold your personal feelings back. Right now is her time to shine.

    Shujing: I did it!
    Teacher: Yes you did. (smile)
    Teacher: Want to do it again?
    Shujing: Yes
    Teacher: Let's get it Shujing!


1. The struggle is Beneficial

    Why don't you get it? This is easy.
    Are you stupid? Cmon. Hurry up.

    I have said these words before.
    Words I can never take back.

    What I understand now is the struggle is beneficial.
    When a child doesn't understand something, 
    Usually, it is because a crucial piece is missing.
    All they need is that little link, and then it all clicks together.

    When the child struggles, it is like their brain is trying to connect 2 neurons together to reach the little link.

    But they cant.
    The brain keeps trying.
    Keeps struggling.
    But it just cant make the connection.

    Like jumping up to touch the basketball rim.
    Keep jumping.
    Keep jumping.
    But cant touch it.
    Will I ever be able to touch it the child wonders?
    Should I just give up?

    The feeling of a young

    You do?
    I do

    One day, they will wake up and touch it.
    I have seen it again and again and again.

    Students who seem "dumb" overnight, become "smart."


1. The words "dumb", "smart", "easy", "best" are not allowed.

    Yes, some children are naturally gifted.
    Yes, some children take a bit longer.

    Smart?
    Dumb?
    Talented?

    Of course. These things are real.
    But that's not what early education is about.

    Early education is about planting seeds of power.

    The seed of confidence
    The seed of beliving in one's own hands
    The seed of saying, "I can", "I will", "I want to"

1. Support winning with grace. Support defeat with safety.

    If I fail, I wont be loved anymore.
    Better to not do it.
    Better to not even try.

    The key is safety.
    
    There will always be defeats.
    But the mark of

    G


Supreme Frustation

    WHY ARE YOU SO STUPID?
    
    In chinese:
    In russian:

    Not fully comprehending


    Supreme frustration will happen.
    Like we are taken by an invisible force.

    It usually happens when explaining something, and the child doesn't seem to be listening at all. The child is doodling And then BAM. All the frustrations from the week. All of it flows out. 

    Ugh.
    Why is this kid so hard?
    Why isn't anything working.
    My kid just isn't good at this for some reason.

Teaching is not for everyone (part 1)

    There is a specific skill that all good teachers have.
    The ability to feel what the student is feeling.

    My dad 
    when children feel that you are not feeling them, they will not listen

Spending Quality Time is for everyone

Becky | Lisa, would you guys like to try a parent-child reading program?

Early Education is very different from Matured Education

Think of it as a journey across the ocean.

But most importantly, what you actually do, when you get off the ship.

Every night,

I have an accent. 
My voice doesn't sound good.
I don't want my child to pick up my shitty english.

That is not what your child picks up.
Your child picks up your feelings.
Picks up your feeling of wanting to get it over with


A crucial decision

15 to 30 minutes a day
reading together

My dad, who I love fondly, who loves me fondly, has never read a word to me my whole life. Seriously not for him. I am so happy he never even tried.

What if he had read this?
What if he thought, oh shit, I should read with my boy.
What if he had forced himself, to 

I would probably hate reading. 
Play to your strengths.
Maybe a husband or wife.
Maybe an uncle or grandparent.

Lisa, this is going to sound super weird.

I do not have any romantic feelings for Kawabe.

But this is what I see in her.

I see a dependable person
I see caring and responsibility
I see someone who enjoys children

She speaks mando, canto, english, and vietnamese.
She knows Brooklyn, and she knows Staten Island.

Uncle Kevin

Purely work. 

The moment a child can speak, is the moment he or she can start learning to read.
Like ocean waves, every day a little more, and like magic, one day it just happens.

I can't ...
I can't ...
I can't ...
I can!

Sharing a language together.
That the world hasn't changed much all these years.

Maylynn knows the ideas.
Maylynn knows the advice that we have.

But my words can protect a few.

Words that truly have a story to tell.

Hi dad
Read with me dad.
Listen to me read the words.

okay p.
im listening.
im listening to you read the words.

Our first word is "big". Super super big!

hmm. What does the word big mean p?

Oh come on dad. You know what "big" means. Big means big!

Big like a mountain

big like the sky

big like the ocean

big like a tasty apple pie

look at the sky dad

i'm looking

Do you see what I see?

I do

I see the stars.
So many twinkling stars in the night.
They are not big at all.
They look so small!

They look so small because they are so far away.
Millions and millions and millions of miles away.
But up close, they are actually very big.

Bigger than a TV?

Bigger than a TV.

Bigger than a house?

Bigger than even the sun!

That's so big!
One day, I want to be big.
Right now, I'm just a kid.

You are big p. There's a star inside of you.

A star inside of me?
I dont see it.

You will.

When? 

When the sun is shining,

And the birds are singing,

When the squirrels are dancing,

And my friends are laughing,

When the taste of apple pie is warm inside your tummy,

You will.

I will!

Growing old and growing bitter
If my mom wanted to change, she would have changed.
That is absolutely true.
People have a lot of opportunities to change.
I didn't say anything terribly mean.

Unable to create joy
My mom, unable to create joy

Go earlier and leave.
Someone you can talk to.

Why did I do anything?
Often, it was a triggered feeling.
Mindless and meaningless sex.
Pride for yourself.
We have really different friends.
That I look relatively normal.
But I have to be normal, if I am to teach these kids.
Trying to find release. Sisterly friends.


I understand it now.
That maybe she did.
But there would have been no feelings.
Never talking again.

To download it for your child. Chinese is important.
A horrible feeling.

Assholes.
The best chance.

Two on two stories.
Curating the stories.


To buy something? Absolutely not.
Going into their 40s.
The need to be beautiful.



To picket the fence.  

The feelings are not good.

A math teacher.

Sister and me Stories

Come with me sister. We are off to take a journey.
Oh sister my sister, what kind of journey shall we take?
A journey to the moon.
I don't want to go to the moon.

A journey to the north pole.
I don't want to go to the north pole.

Well where do you want to go?
A place of magic.

Not too big on traveling.

I know just the place. 

Mom wont know.

Help me mix the flour.

Oh brother my brother. 

Gold Star Worksheets. 

A story teller. Who happens to teach math.

Do you know what you're doing?

Of course.

Oh sister my sister, how would you know without trying?

The knives are dangerous. Butter. Playful.

A little bit of ketchup.
And a big spoon of mustard!

The parents like to sing. So the child learns how.


And over here ... donuts.

Maybe.

That's too long.

What do you see?
All I see is me.

Create your child's curriculum.
Create something special.

The story of a feeler.
To be tuned in to different feelings.



Are you sure dad?
Stars are really big.
How can something that big be inside me?







Wouldn't that be kind of uncomfortable?

It is the star that lives inside of you. 

The protections crafted from the inside.
That it is not someone else doing the protecting, that it is your own spirit giving the protection.
The protections crafted when you are most vulnerable.

Howie has changed. Johnny.












For real?
What does it look like?
But 

A lot of writing.
A lot of feeling. But to channel it. Into productive means. Tiffany, we had no chance. Good to see you Becky. Lisa! You're the same. Just older. Saw the collapse at.

That's so big!
Why do they look so small?





I cant see it.
You will.

To have money, but to lose your feelings.
Taking care of the two of you.
I know everyone here.
And everyone knows me.
I am the teacher.





They don't tell you that you lose all your  friends.


Look at that tiny star. Do you see it p?
I see it

It is bigger than the sun.

No it's not!
The sun is so big and that star is so small!

It has to be a respectful story. 
To not gossip about people.
To laugh and smile like that.
To be independent.






Because we are so far away.


Planting the idea that big and small is relative to perspective.
To feel protected.

A way with words.


Jimmy is tired because he has to battle two realities. And the reason he has to battle the realities is because he has to provide for his family. He has no choice, but to provide for his family.

I am little.
Are you sure about that?

Science, feeling, philosophy, and learning


It is because we are so far away
But actually, that tiny star is bigger than the sun


Combinations ...
You have to be ready ...

To write the cheering posters ...

I do not give instructions.

To show that you are part of this society.
To not recognize yourself anymore.
To understand the feeling of a soul.

We happened to be a part of it.



















Im small.
As big as the sun.
As big as the stars.

A story that protects you from afar.

The strongest protection charm is the protection of family.
The boys are unconscious.
To not offer like that. They reacted in exactly the same way.

When the feelings are real.

My mom is doing something that is hard for her.























Let it flow like water

    Teaching theory for mathematics has lots of rules.
    Do this. And then do that. And then do that.

    High schoolers can take this type of teaching.
    Extremely structured. Extremely organized.
    The high schooler brain can thrive.
    
    When I teach high school math, I am a man pounding iron into steel.
    More information. More information.
    I push students to their limits, and then push a little more.
    Because their brains can take it.
    They kind of enjoy the challenge.

    The vast majority of elementary schoolers cannot take this.
    
    The big difference is high schoolers are conscious learners.
    Young children are unconscious learners.

    








As much time as you have, 
    Do you believe me?


Being a teacher, on the surface seems easy. But it is not.

Hi guys,

If any of you are in search of volunteer service hours for school, maybe this letter will be of a little interest you.

Volunteer Service 1:
    With a friend, or multiple friends, 
    use your phone to make an audio recording cheering for someone.

    Here is an example cheering dialogue written for Kevin & Wei
    Here is an example cheering dialogue written for Eric & Oscar & Evan

Volunteer Service 2:

    Just like Volunteer Service 1, except video instead of audio.

Volunteer Service 3:
    
    Just like Volunteer Service 1 and 2, except in Chinese.

Volunteer Service 4:
    Reading easy stories with 1st and 2nd graders
    Reading math stories with 4th graders

Volunteer Service 5:
    Just like #4 except reading them in Chinese.
    help See this blogpost incase you are worried you can't read Chinese.

Volunteer Service 6:
    Writing your own stories for children and reading it with them.

Volunteer Service 7:
    Creating Cheering Posters (English and Chinese)

Compensation:

In return for your work, you will get:

Volunteer Service Hours rounded up to the nearest hour.
That means 10 minutes of reading equals 1 hour of volunteer service
2 minutes of cheering equals 1 hour of volunteer service

Any creative work you is rounded to the nearest 5 hours.

    Spend 28 minutes to make a poster for a student equals 5 hours of volunteer service.
    Spend 3 hours to write a story equals 5 hours of volunteer service.

Every time you volunteer, you will get a future usable reference letter, recommendation letter, or reference phone call.

    In the years 2026 to 2035, you may be applying for lots of jobs, and many jobs require a reference or recommendation. 

See this blogpost on references and recommendations

I write what I see.

One time I saw Wei highfive a new player and Wei said, "Good shit."
This will let me write a paragraph about how Wei is welcoming and encouraging and support.

One time, I fell to the ground and Evan reached out his hand to pull me up. This will let me write a paragraph about how Evan is caring.

Do something positive once. And then I can write about it.

Sometimes, you might feel tempted to "game" this system.
When I write letters for students, it comes from my heart.
It is hard for me to write a good letter when I feel I am being taken advantage of, or being tricked. You will still get a letter. But my heart probably wont be in it.

Goofing off



The feelings can be misinterpreted.
Lives of quiet desperation.
You cant be too smart to work at boeing it seems?

When 2 people share the same pain.
We dont share the same pain.

Stories for the kids to read together.
Reading with the cousins.
Not the feeling I was looking for.
Never. To read some of the stories.

Rather than put it on Kawabe, I put it on Lisa.
Her own will. 

Stories. Because too close to the parents.
Working at Boeing ... you have to be a certain way.

Reaching out to someone over the years.

The emotions can change drastically.

I forgot.
There were many things I would've done differently.
The footprint of my karma.




Hey Bobby,

Sorry about the above message.



I didnt give a shit back then.

I was just as disgusted.

Hurt her friend Jennifer.

There is no redemption.
There is no forgiveness.

I was not as bad a person as I looked.

My parents didnt have any feelings for me.

There was an explosion of negative feelings.

Just a bad feeling.

08-11-2023 Tiffany Giang Letter - Memories from a Long Time Ago

Hi Tiffany,

I want to share some of my memories with you.

I joined Taekwondo at Master Lee's because I had gotten punched in the eye at school. It was here, that I met my good friend Tristan.

I loved Tristan and his family. At school, I didn't really have close friends. At home, I felt kind of disconnected from my parents. Getting punched was a blessing in disguise. Tristan took me in, welcomed me as a friend. Welcomed me to his sisters, to his family.

There was a girl at taekwondo. Her name was Tiffany. 
Tristan and I never talked about you. 
I saw you from time to time, but never thought anything of it.

There is one memory that stays with me. It is during the warm-up stretches when all of us are facing Master Lee doing the stretches.

Tristan and me are goofing around. You're somewhere nearby and you have a smile on your face. Kind of a smile that says, "these dumb idiots" but in a nice way.

----------------------------------
One day, I stopped going to Taekwondo.
I don't know why. 
I lost touch with Tristan.
Graduated high school.
Went to UW.
And then I met Tristan again! Spring of freshman year. Red square.
Standing in front of me was Tristan!!!

"Good to see you bro."
I know Tristan said this because that's what he always says.
Tristan and I became friends again.
We stayed in touch and got an apartment for sophomore year.
Tristan. Me. And Carsen.

----------------------------------
It is October of sophomore year. Tristan mentions your name.

I think Tristan tells me that he went on a date with you or hung out with you. I think all of us go somewhere for Halloween. Tristan. Me. You. Lisa and Becky. Some other people. 

At some point, I start having a crush on you.
I wish I never betrayed Tristan. I knew he liked you.

----------------------------------
One night, we are having a party at our apartment.
We have 2 folding chairs.
You are sitting in one of them.
You are drinking something.
Your face is getting really red.

I started getting angry.
Why was I angry?
Who was I angry at?

Maybe because someone was telling you to drink.
Maybe because you were listening to them telling you to drink.

I don't know what happens next.
Suddenly, we are walking back to your dorm.
We didn't say a single word.
You were shivering a little bit.
You said, "I'm cold".

I saw you shivering.
I remember your voice.
I ignored you.

I remember feeling a strange sensation that this is not who Tiffany is.
I knew you were cold.
But I didnt want to do anything.

I don't think I said bye to you.
I think we got to your dorm.
And then I just left.

---------------------------------------

One day, I realize your class is after mine.
It is in the morning. I hatch a marvelous plan. I'm going to tell you that I like you.

Why couldn't I have just talked to you? Why didn't I just say, "Tiffany want to get some coffee some time?" No marvelous plan necessary.

Sigh. I know why I couldn't talk to you. I was a scared little boy with nothing interesting to say.

So I must've planned it for a month. Today is the day! Actually, let's do it next week because it's kind of foggy today. 

Well one day, I finally do it. I finish class. I leave. And I see you. Did I say even hi to you? Probably not. I think what I do is give you a folded piece of paper.

I think I wrote on it, that I liked you and wanted to get coffee???
The only thing I know for certain is that I bolted out of there. I was embarrassed out of my mind.

That night I took a shower. I punched the bathroom wall. Apparently, the wall was not solid. My hand went right through it. Tristan asked me what happened to the bathroom. (When we moved out, we had to pay a fine)

I told him about you.
I told him I confessed my feelings.
We called the event "hiroshima."
Tristan would tease me about hiroshima.
I would feel ashamed.

At some point, Tristan told me you had a new boyfriend.
Hearing that, I felt really empty. Like something hollow in my chest.

There was one bright side. Me and Tristan were back to being friends.
-----------------------------------------

I was in a fraternity.
In a fraternity, you are taught to never call it a "frat".

The idea of a fraternity is noble. 
Brothers to support each other.
That's not what we were. We were a frat.

The older guys in the frat were so cool.
I wanted to be cool.
I was feeling so many negative emotions.
I threw myself into it "being cool". Pulling girls. Getting laid.

Later on, way after graduation, I would remember a memory about what "cool" really was. It is the memory of you asking Bobby something along the lines of "how many girls have you been with." Bobby said none.

And you couldn't believe it. You said, "you're lying."
And Bobby said, "I'm not."
I was right there. I couldn't believe it either. Bobby is such a cool guy. None?
Only now, as a grown man, do I understand just how cool Bobby was.

-----------------------------------------
Time passes. I'm becoming more and more of a piece of shit.
I start dating a girl named M.
She is smart. She won't kiss me.
One night at a frat party, I cheat on her with my friend's date. Her name is J.

I start seeing J. It is mostly physical. 
It is my first time kissing a girl.
We are together for a few weeks.
Then we stop.
I haven't thought about you at all.

One day, I get a facebook invite to your birthday party.

It's at Thaddeus's house. Thaddeus doesn't like me. I know Thaddeus. He knows me. And he knows I'm a piece of shit.

I didn't bring you a birthday gift.
I didn't bring you a birthay card.
Did I even wish you happy birthday?
We took a picture together.
You know what I did after we took the picture?

I started making out with a drunk girl. J is at your party. And she sees me doing this. She lets out a feeling of pain.

God bless Thaddeus.
He rips the girl off of me, and starts making out with her. INTENSELY.
J is close with Thaddeus.
Thaddeus is doing this to protect her and make her feel better.
I leave. 

That's the end of the story. 
After that, I never saw you again, and I didn't really care.
I didn't think about you anymore. After all, what was there to think about? I was a disgusting piece of shit.

----------------------------------
Junior year and senior year. I dated a girl named A. She was wonderful. I was still a piece of shit. I learned kindness from her. First I learned kindness from Tristan and his family. Then I learned it from her.
----------------------------------
College was ending.
I needed to leave Washington.
I needed to run away.
Run away from who I was.
Run away from this person that I hated.

I moved to New York.
I discovered teaching.
I discovered that I was a good teacher.

Students had no idea what a piece of shit I was.
To them, I was just Mr. Lee.
For some people, teaching is a job.
For me, it was a way to heal.
I would write stories for my students.
I would find ways to make them feel powerful.
I loved being a teacher.
----------------------------------

I am not a piece of shit anymore.
Many years have passed.
A decade has passed.
I don't hate myself anymore.
Disappointed yes.
Angry yes.
But no more hate. 
The only time I hate myself, is when I think about the past.

-----------------------------------------
I saw Lisa's family on Wednesday. I haven't seen Lisa in over 10 years. 

Would you believe it? The area I have been living in, is the area her husband grew up in!

Seeing Lisa's family made me want to talk to you.



Wishing you well Tiffany.

Kevin

Lisa, I have been writing stories for students.
I usually write 4th grade math stories because that's what I teach.

After seeing your kids, the other day, I wrote a story for Phoebe.

My stories are dialogue scripts.
In my class, the children take turns reading the lines.
That is how I teach math. I am not the teacher. The children are.

What I wrote for Phoebe is just like this. Except not for math. It is for learning how to read.

It is Phoebe reading with Mom.
Or Phobe reading with Dad.

PS: You might think I am doing this for you and your family. I'm not.

I'm doing this for me.
I believe in these stories.
I believe parents will buy them one day.

Let me know if you would like to try them out.
And if you think they're useful, maybe recommend it to Becky too :p

To diminish the value.
To act a certain way.

Boys, say yes. I promise, one of the best things in college, is to say yes to everything. (except drugs and like bad stuff)
timmy ge. Mei you tan.
Boys. Watch this. George, mei you tan. yi ke tang ye mei you.



And if you genuinely think it is useful for a young child to learn how to read, (please dont be polite - you need to actually think, yo this shit is good) to recommend it to Becky as well :p



My second customer. Oh yeah oh yeah!

Hi Sae-eun, 

I hope you, your husband, and your family are doing well.

I am a teacher now.
I see students all the time.
I was relaxing at the park a few days ago and started thinking about myself in high school.

I want to share a memory with you.

I hope this memory is fun for you to read.
It was fun (and a little bittersweet) for me to write.


It is junior year of high school. A group of us have a break before our afternoon class. Randy, Sam, Maria, Liz, Saeeun, Hunter, Jennifer, and me. We often hang out in the study room at the library.

One day, Saeeun handed out birthday invitations to everyone. I couldn't believe that I got an invitation too.

I had physics in the morning with Saeeun. She sat on the far right side of the classroom. I sat on the far left side. I often spent a good amount of time just staring at her.

Her invitation was written on a small red card. Saeeun's handwriting. On the days leading up to her birthday, how many times did I look at that little card? I don't know. But I looked at it a lot. 

Finally, the day comes. It's Saeeun's birthday! 

My mom drives me to Red Robin and drops me off.
I am really nervous and really excited.
Inside the Red Robin, it feels kind of quiet.
I asked the front clerk, "Is there a birthday party?"
And she says, "I don't think so."

I started walking around all the booths. 
I kept expecting to see someone. Maybe Maria. Maybe Jennifer. Maybe Randy.
But no one. Just different families having dinner.

Maybe everyone hadn't arrived yet.
I waited.
And then I called my mom. 
I asked her to pick me up.

On the car ride home, I called Saeeun.
I said, "I'm sorry I missed your birthday."

I had gotten Saeeun a gift. It was some sort of soap or lotion. The bag was blue with a ribbon on the top. The next week at school, in the library, I gave Saeeun a gift card. So maybe... I didnt get Saeeun a gift at all. Based on who I was back then, it wouldn't surprise me. All I know for sure is that I was in the library, and I gave Saeeun something.

I wondered how it happened. How did I get the date wrong? I had looked at Saeeun's card so much. Did I really get it wrong? It didn't make any sense to me.

I stopped thinking about it. 
I stopped thinking about Saeeun. 
Life went on.


That's the end of the memory :P.








Growing together.





Are you ready mom?
Are you ready to read on a tree?

No Phoebe. Not at all.
I'm scared as ever can be.

Oh well. I guess we'll have to come back next week.

I can see the birds flying through the air.
I can see so many things. You see mom, this is why we read on a tree.

I hope it is a little bit useful for you.

Wishing you well,

To take care of feelings.


What a mean prank to pull.
The memory was wrong.


But I do deserve it.

To feel certain pains.

To be friends.

I wouldnt have sent this, if I wasnt.

Unable to give positive emotions.
To not give an explanation.

Something is wrong with my hands.
That it cannot be written?

08-12-2023 Saeeun

I am not sure that is a good idea. My parents moved to Monroe. It is extremely far. Getting up the hill that require chains on your tires. I do not think the travel time is worth it.


I remember when Saeeun forgave me. It was a sudden smile of acceptance.
High school is not the best environment.
Extracting positive from negative.

A place where my feelings can 



You too. 

You hurt Kevin really badly. But that was when I was a blank slate.
Saeeun. I'm fine. I wouldn't have sent this if I wasn't.
That was 16 or 17 years ago.

To care. I'm really sorry. Did a really cruel thing.


Little boys get hurt ... they pass the hurt on. 
Little girls get hurt ... they pass the hurt on. 

Seattle, in its own way, was a cruel place to grow up in.
To fit into the system.

Practical. 

A calm surrender.

Printing the Placards.

Saeeun didnt know. To not. We have to take a picture!
This is the best day of my life!


But the endpoint is kindness. Two things are inevitable. Kindness and death. You will wish for your children to experience kindness.
Uncle Kevin. 

They can feel the feelings ... 

What a mean prank. Without even realizing it.
What a cruel thing to do.
Never talked about the fraternity.



And super fast.
Will your husband be there?

Most certainly!
Saeeun I'm fine. I wouldn't have sent this if I wasn't.
Hey Yijie, want to play some soccer.

I have made certain sacrifices.
Hi Yijie. If you have some time, want to do some (gentle) soccer training?

I was thinking maybe we could do it at a park, somewhere in between your house and my parent's house. (where I am staying)

Darkness created.

What if I had experienced that? It would've hurt a lot. 

It was at our 10 year high school reunion. You never know what a person goes through. I never cried back then over it. Maybe that is why I am crying now. An innocent prank, which had such grave meanings. Giving a gift that didn't mean anything. When it met everything.




I gave her a sad memory. Something that you never knew. I am not looking for anything.

Lol. That is absolutely lol. Did you know that ... there was some pain? That is even better. To learn something new.



To find the truth.
To learn the truth.

Nobody ever talked to us.

To not be on there anymore.
Has been on your mind.

There are nothing ...

Yeah.

I followed what my mom did.
A blow from nowhere.

It never touched.




Hi Mom, I wrote a few tips for you and dad.

It is tips for seeing old friends.
You and dad already know all of this.

I just want to share it in my words.


Accept compliments, and then move on.

Wow your house is so pretty, so big, so wonderful.

Sometimes, 

You can just say, "yes it is." And then move the subject on. Dont need to say, "no no its not" or "it's just okay."

truthfully, the house is quite wonderful. no one cannot deny that. Acknowledge it and move forward.

You can also combat the positive point with a negative point.

For example, 

Comment: Wow your house is amazing!

Reply: It is. But oh my goodness. Did you know? It is in the middle of no where. Everyday, the drive to work is so long. Sometimes I wish we didn't have to travel so far.

And then transition to a different topic.

2. Prefer indirect over direct questions.

//For casual conversation, Direct questions are sometimes a littl
"When will you have your next child?"

You can ask the same question in a much gentler way.

"Have you thought about giving Norah a brother or sister?"

An indirect question creates much less pressure.

3. Remember to enjoy your friend

We always have to look good.
Present well.
Show good qualities.

But old friends do not care about that.
An old friend just wants to hear your voice and see your face.

Reading Chinese




Hi Aaron and George,

I have some work you might be interested in.

It is reading to kids in Chinese.

What you will get in return:

Recommendation Letters for College Applications or Jobs (up to 10)
The label of "Assistant Chinese Teacher" on a website.
Volunteer Service Hours
Food or Money

Explanation of Food or Money

You with a group of kids: You will only get Food. Like a sandwich and chips after.

However, the parents will have your phone number. And this is a chance to be paid real money.

Training: 

Training is not paid.
You will not get food for it.
You will get volunteer hours.

The training will be done together.



Chinese Ability

All you need is the ability to read pinyin.
The things you

You might not be able to read Chinese characters very well.
But you can definitely read pinyin. 




I want to emphasize, the chance of making money is low.
It depends on the parents.

In Sunset Park, many parents do not have that much money.

I am good at writing recommendation letters.


You might be wondering, will I be making money from this?

The answer is no.
I will make a little bit.
But it is mostly going to be used for buying materials, printing papers, buying food. I will post the budget online.

If I am not making money, why am I doing it?

I believe in 5-10 years, it will be possible to make money.
What I am doing now, is an investment.

If this works out, parents will believe in it.

If you mess around, that is okay.
I remem


One way or another, I will see that you get your share.

            return args.pop()
        }
        return {}
    }

Before, yline(mark) was not registering mark as an object.
This is because popper pops it out.
So we have changed popper to require more than one arg.
This entire popper function should be edited at some point.
However, the idea of it is good.

This inline system can be used by young children
d3 absolutely cannot. This is one advantage

it omits a lot of things. you dont need to save variables because they get pushed into local state

I was wondering where vue.create() was being called because it was not present in the component. The answer is it was in the template.

08-16-2023 Twice

The document tree needs to be built twice because the first time, it doesnt see itself.

08-16-2023 Todo

VTable is seriously a table.
Editing with the colors ... kind of hurts the eyes
Also have to look back and forth ... back and forth
Having the document tree is seriously helpful ...
a way to download as json
download the file ...
why are the buffers not updating? at the very start? it should say the buffers that are open ... a delay has been set on them

a way to edit the v-table
the before and after ... are being done in the wrong place


the positioning of after|before is wrong.
it goes one below where it should be going.

    codeBuilder
    pure html
    anything defined as an escape block
        observable does it as js``

It transpiles into a pure html template
But if this is true, you wont be able to leverage data
Therefore, maybe transpile into into a vue component
I am not so sure how  to approach it

You can use modules with scopedEvaluator
effectively, you can use any type of key-accessible object

A drawback of scopedEvaluator is every dep used must be listed
even primary deps like "sayhi" or "findall"
all of them, from every single module, must be listed in the scope

checking for error is more effective than checking for success
you can succeed and the result may be undefined (side-effects only)
this is what 

You can spread multiple modules together. (modules work with spread operators) This can create a super scope to be used with the evaluator.

A reverse cursed technique processes negative energy into positive energy. As a result, the energy that destroys becomes energy that creates, and negative energy becomes positive. Despite sounding simple enough, producing reverse cursed energy is extremely complex and difficult to perform for most jujutsu users.

https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Reverse_Cursed_Technique

Video Demonstration of Cursed Energy and Reversed Cursed Eenergy


Kevin likes to use negative energy
    lose
    suck
    cant win
    et cetera

... which is fine.
There is nothing inherently wrong with negatives.
Depending on the situation, negatives can be advantageous.


Reverse cursed energy is hard.
In jujutsu kaizen, maybe 3 people do it.

In real life, reverse cursed energy is not just pretending to be positive or pretending to be happy. You have to feel it from the bottom of your heart. The power doesnt come from words. The power comes from inside of you.


Again, there is nothing wrong with negative energy.
It depends on how you use it.

An Good Use of Negative Energy 

Playing lockdown defense on your opponent.
"I am not going to let you score."
"I am not going to let you have a single point."
"I will make you feel scared to even dribble the basketball."

This clearly benefits you and your team.

A Questionable Use of Negative Energy 

"We suck."
"We are going to lose."
"There's no way we can win."
This usage of negative energy ... hmmmmm ... emoji:puzzled
Doesn't doing this benefit your opponent?
Why are you helping the other team?

Words and statements can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
The power of self-fulfilling prophecies is real.
What kind of prophecy do you want for the future?

A Good Use of Negative Energy

Your Friend: "I suck. I'm going to fail."
You: "Bob, you're a f**king d***ass. You don't suck. You're not going to fail. You're going to WIN. You're going to SUCCEED."

Or: 

Your Friend: "I suck. I'm going to fail."
You: "I refuse to believe that."

One of the most powerful uses of negative energy is canceling out other negative energy. The negative of the negative becomes a positive.

Don't think about the past

Don't think about missing
Don't think about making 
Don't think about winning
Don't think about losing
Don't think about the people watching
Don't think about what people will say (good or bad)

Don't think.

Let the moment wash over you,
Your mind is in your muscle,
Feel the energy pass through you,
Your body will take care of the rest.

Wei Shooting Tips

Dear Wei,

When you shoot a basketball, 
The power comes from the energy you give to the ground.

Like a coiled spring, you push into the ground,
And the ground pushes back.

The energy flows upwards.
Passes through your toes,
Enters through your feet,
Runs up your legs,
Goes into your spine,
Through your shoulders,
Flows into your arms,
Passes through your wrists,
Into your hands,
Off your finger tips,
Into the ball.

It is a cascading waterfall.
A waterfall that transfers energy from you,
To the ground,
Back to you,
To the ball.

I challenge you Wei, to become the waterfall.

A smooth line of chakra.
Unbroken.

Visualize it.
The energy is real.

A brief moment before you jump.
Your knees are bent.
Your energy is surging into the ground.

You lift off.
The energy rebounds back to you.
The energy is in the bones of your feet.
It begins to travel through your legs, through your body.
Guide the energy to the ball.

Waterfalls are beautiful.
They flow with grace,
And crash with thunder.

Graceful and strong.
This is the way of the waterfall.

Rule 1

Rule 2

The Most Important Rule

Please don't blame each other.
Please don't tell on each other.
Please be loyal to each other.

As school starts soon.
It takes courage to go and play.
Something predictable.
That maybe one day you will read the words.
My parents did the best they could do.
Given the circumstances.

Nothing to say.
Good things happened around me.
To do a few things.

Rule 3

Accountability & Responsibility

Messing up is okay.
Messing up and then hiding it ... this creates so many problems.

Randomly filling out.

Please just say, I don't feel like working today and skip work.






Please do not do this.
I would rather you mess up 100 times then mess up 1 time and hide it.


Maybe not this year.

I'm kind of busy right now. Can I take a break from this?
Would it be okay



Rule 4 - Shit Happens

Boys, would you like a challenge?
Would you like to try a challenge?

A mental challenge.
What will we get for it?
What do you want?

I've had it for about 10 weeks.
Ask it in a slow way.
Do not be intrusive.

Creating some conditions.
To help the young one advance upwards.

Talking to my aunt feels much more safe, than talking to my mom.
I don't know why.
Maybe this is what Yeye felt.

Ultimately, the system and all its shards, run in a different direction.
To hide the kindness.
Hide the kindness in places that are not obvious at all.
Because kindness is often thought of as a disadvantage.
You need to "take" and "call your own fouls."

Having lots of friends, this old man.
Time passes and passes.




A shell to handle the pain.
I found salvation inside of my friends.

I forgot ... that it is going to be used against me.
I totally forgot.

You have to protect yourself.

Put your thoughts away.
Put all of your energy into playing.

Play so hard, you don't have time to think about anything.

A strange sensation.
A strange feeling.
My safety bells are going off.
Vibes of Robert

The War of Art
Being manipulated by someone older
Being twisted into it

To have this feeling ...
To be in lethargy ...

Afraid of everything
Skeptical ... being taken advantage of ...

There is a feeling of lawlessness and helplessness here
Makes me a little uncomfortable.
As you go forth.

That is the feeling that the parents got.
The feeling of

That it is just him here. Buying a used bicycle.
To stay at a hostel.

It is the feeling of Robert
He gives me the same feeling that Robert gives me.
To be held accountable

Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe my feeling is wrong.
But my first instinct usually isnt.

I am sensing something beneath the surface.
It appears I have made my decision.

We can still hang out.
Just have to pick me up a little bit.

Puerto Rico

The beaches are very beautiful.
But truthfully, I did not like it very much.

Writing a "vacation blog" is usually supposed to only be positive.
I will skip my negative feelings and focus on the positive. Talking negative things is not that fun for me. Also, what is negative for me, maybe is not negative for someone else.

However, I will just say one thing which I think is useful for traveling anywhere: Be aware of surroundings.

For example:
Do not stand directly behind a car or a motorcycle.
When group of vehicles coming near you, give them lots of space.

----------------------------------

Puerto Rico has beach after beach after beach.
Actually, it is probably just one beach. It is the long coastline that stretches for miles and miles.

Think of a sandwich. Bread, meat, bread.
In Puerto Rico, it is Beach, Road, Land.
And on the land, will usually be a small bar or restaurant.

It is not the kind of restaurant or bar you see in the city.
It is just a shack. Usually, you sit outside.
Constructed from wood.
Some don't have electricity. 
Just large tanks of propane gas to power everything.

Many tourists stop by these food places.
And then drive a little bit to the beach.

It has a very country feel.


The main tourist area is called San Juan.
This is the city center, and has the most hotels, hostels, and tourist attractions. Basically, it is the Manhattan version of Puerto Rico. It has many popular beaches.

But because these beaches are so popular, and so advertised, they always have lots of people. People who know me, know that I never like taking the main road.

The beaches we went to were about 1 hour west of San Juan.
The first beach had a good amount of people. There were lots of people swimming. Lots of people on the sand. One big group was having a barbeque. They had brought their own grill. Also, they had a table set up with many colorful (alcholic drinks).

The second beach had 6-7 people. 
A young boyfriend and girlfriend.
An old lady and her friend.
And some other people.

This huge beach, on a Sunday afternoon, with such few people? A dream come true for me.

But the third beach was my favorite.
It was the biggest beach. Stretching for a long mile.
No hard rocks. Just pure sand.

Something very different about this beach. It just felt cleaner.







At these beaches, it was mostly local people. Everyone

Merely, it is a possibility of something that could happen.
And that if it did, I would enjoy it.

Hi Ashley,

How are you?
Where are you in your travels now?

If you would like to share,
I would like to listen.

I said ... and I will make it true.
I will make it true.

A sudden dawning realization.
It is ... 
That life is hard ...

It is what I want.
It is what I see as being possible.

For her to see it.
I dont have a job right now. but i use to be a teacher.
but i have become one.

Hi Ashley,

How are you?

Would you like to chat on the phone some time?
I would like to catch up with a friend (you).





I was wondering if 

I would like to hear about the going-ons of your life.
I would like to tell you about the going-ons of my life.


The history of a person.
The feelings that are passed down.




That we are just friends.
That you haven't had genuine friends.
Liked it.
To not hear anything.
To be able to piece it together.



True.
Truth.
Right now, I am working on a project.
And I dont really want to talk about it.
How valuable truth is.






Can we talk again maybe in a few months?

Living separated.

Every picture is harmless.




She is a kid.
She is 1 year older than Maylynn
She is about Keeley's age.


I dont really laugh with anyone.
No words.



To assume that you know someone.
But actually, you know nothing.

The college experience.






That was fast.

Im not. But im trying to be.


PS - Anytime you want to talk to someone, I am always available.

Did you enjoy it?
Whispering to the child in the womb.

She could feel something didn't make sense.


I did.








This was a lot of fun.
Do you think we could talk again.

















That I have to make these things right.
I projected forward.
There will be nothing like that.




When you lie, you dont give people the full truth.
And they feel it.


The effects of the lie.
I didnt want to say the truth.
When you dont give the truth ...
I lied.


To be beautiful ...
It can feel like a curse



Sometimes go up.
Talk in silence.

I'm not in New York Lev.
Thank you for this invitation.
Our deal has been honored.







I projected forward what I was going to be.






----------------------------------------

It was very nice to meet you.
It was very nice to meet you too.
Take care.
Do you have instagram?
I do.

Suddenly, I understand the feeling.
After school teacher.
That maybe I was wrong.




Keeley didnt like me at the time.
Keeley merely saw me as safe.
And that is what Ashley sees.
I am safe.
Until I am not.
Her eyes sparkled because she was happy.
Happy to be 

To not understand. 



:D :D :D

The sadness of the world.
Suddenly becomes brighter for me.


From the boring everyday stuff, to the exciting moments.

I see in Ashley, Keeley.
I literally see her.
I am not trying to date her.
I suddenly see something that can go forward.
I see a second chance.
I see that it is not me.
I see a chance to help someone.

What I wrote is wrong.

I have seen lots of attractive people.
Over the years.
I am starting to understand.



I'm happy you like it. 

But I shouldn't have written it. 
In my opinion, the only person I'm allowed to challenge is myself.

Texting is hard for me. I always write dumb stuff. I would trade washing dishes for 1 hour vs. 1 minute of texting.


Ashley is a girl who happened to be born beautiful in America. Which is kind of a curse. She is also mixed from two ethnicities. Another curse. Hey guys. She embraced being hot. Lol. We defend ourselves in various ways. 

She has met cute guys. Thousands. Really suave asian guys. For sure. Guys who I cannot even begin to imagine. 

Could he be the one?
To be a certain way.

Or to not to.

I have never had a real conversation via text. Unless you count video games. A lot of my feelings come from seeing and hearing the other person. Texting makes me feel like a robot.

Treating her like an object. I never did. Authentic. With Reuben. 
I did not show any mercy.

Lots of asian guys at Virginia Tech.





Would you like to talk on the phone sometime Ashley?
Maybe in a few months, when you are free?

I swear I'm not being sarcastic.
I just really need to focus right now.

:) I look forward to it.
