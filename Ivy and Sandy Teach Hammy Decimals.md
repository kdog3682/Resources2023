Hi $$$,

Can you guys help me with a dividing decimals question?

----------------
ofc h 
----------------

h, the first thing we are going to do is remove decimals from the denom

----------------
h how do u remove decimals from the denom?
----------------
By sliding to the right.

Take a look at

    124 div 0.0002

The 0.0002 has 4 decimal places.
That means we are going to slide 4 times.
----------------

Say it with me $!
----------------
Yes mamn $!
----------------
tg Slide to the right 1! | 0.0002 -> 0.002
----------------
tg Slide to the right 2!| 0.002 -> 0.02
----------------
tg Slide to the right 3!| 0.02 -> 0.2
----------------
tg Slide to the right 4!| 0.2 -> 2

----------------
Look at what happened hammy.
By shifting the decimal 4 times, we turned 0.0002 into 2.

Basically, we removed the decimals.
----------------
h Because you shift the bottom 4 times, does that mean we also shift the top 4 times as well?
----------------
That's exactly right h

In fact, that's the next step
----------------
hh, 

We started with 124.
Now we shift it 4 times, the exact same way as with 0.0002
----------------
h but $, 0.0002 has a decimal point. 124 doesn't have a decimal point.
----------------
It has a decimal h. It's just invisible.

124 is the same as 124.0
----------------
h 
Whole numbers like `124` or `3700` have invisible decim

We started with: 

        124 div 0.0002

Afterwards, we end up with:

        1240000 div 2


----------------

We can solve 1240000 div 2 with long division

@demo
----------------

The final answer is 620000

Thank you $$.
I think I understand it now.
----------------
No problem h.
----------------
h $others, I have prepared some decimal division homework for you.
----------------
What! Decimal division homework for us?
But h, you're the one who needs to practice it.

----------------
h h has to go eat cake1

bye $$
You guys are going to do great
