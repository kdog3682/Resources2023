        Factors are the numbers that can multiply together to make a number.
        The ways to make 16 are 1t16, 2t8, 4t4.
        That means the factors of 16 are 1, 16, 2, 8 and 4.

    instructions: 
        The first step for subtracting fractions is to make sure you have a common denominator. After the denominators match, now you can do normal subtraction.

    standAloneInstructions: 

        The first step for subtracting fractions is to make sure you have a common denominator.
        1/2 - 1/4 
        @warn cant do it because the denoms dont match.
        first we convert 1/2 into 2/4
        now the denominators match!
        2/4 - 1/4 = box(1/4)
