# 6 more than 5
6 more than 5 means right now, I have 5 watermelons. But I want 6 more. The answer is 5 + 6 = 11.

Mr. Sam, can I write 6 + 5 instead of writing 5 + 6?

Please write 5 + 6. The question writes "6 more than 5."
That means we start with 5.
That's why the 5 goes in front.

# 3 less than 8

We start with 8.
Take away 3.
The answer is 8 - 3 = 5

# x less than y

What's x?
x stands for xylophone
But this is math class

You're right $. In math class, x is not a xylophone. x is just x.
But I still don't know what x is.

I heard that x represents a number. x might be the number 123.
Can it be the number 1 million?
If you like.


Can it be the number 1 billion?
Only if you say, "pretty please with a cherry on top."

Guys, for this question, it's not important what x is. All we have to do is follow the pattern we used before.

x less than y.
That means we start with y.
And then we take some x away.
Is the answer y - x?
Great job $. That is correct!

# 6 more than 5 less than 7

The key question to is, "Where do we start?" 

I think we start at the 7.

I think so too because it is the only number by itself.

5 less than 7 is 7 - 5 = 2

And then we add 6 on top of that.

2 + 6 = 8. The final answer is 8.
