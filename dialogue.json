  ],

    "Basically, you convert a percentage into a decimal. And then you multiply by something. And then sometimes you add, and sometimes you subtract."

  [
    "Kaylee",
    "Wait. How did you do that?"
  ],
  [
    "Aaron",
    "I don’t know. You just do it. Like this: 40% becomes 0.40 which is the same as 0.4. "
