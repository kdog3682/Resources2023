899 ... 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO-akX66i24&ab_channel=SimonsInstitute

8 + 9 + 9 = 26
Not divisible by 3 because cant do 26 / 3
Not divisible by 9 because cant do 26 / 9
Not divisible by 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 because not even.
Not divisible by 5 because doesnt end with 5 or 10.

But this question must be doable because the question says there is a trick. Should assume that there must be a factor.

So that leaves 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29 as some of the possibilties.

899 is really close to 900. 

900 - 1 = 899

30^2 - 1^2 = (a + b) (a - b)


Write a mathematical explanation proving 899 is not a prime number.
No division is allowed in your proof.

Sample Proof:

To prove 899 is not a prime number, here is what I did.
I divided 899 by 2. It has a remainder. (no good)
I divided 899 by 3. It has a remainder. (no good)
I divided 899 by 4. It has a remainder. (no good)

I keep going until I find a number n that gives remainder 0.
That means the number is divisible by n.
That means 899 is not a prime number.

This sample proof does not work because the rule says no division is allowed.

30x + 31y + 28 = 365

Find x and find y.

Hint: Look at Question 7.
