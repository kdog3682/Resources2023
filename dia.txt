daniel mr. daniel, do you want to teach them how to do it?
daniel of course Mr. daniel. let’s do it.

hx and I as well!
mch We have a wonderful class. Lucas, Grace, and Hao Xiang are the only students!
evangeline everyone, it is time to begin. Ms. Emily, go ahead.
emily 20 times 30. Mr. Daniel what should we do first?
daniel The first step is to forget about the zeroes. Mr. daniel, what is 2 times 3?
daniel That’s a fantastic question Mr. Daniel. 2 times 3 equals 6.
emily Good job Mr. Daniel. The second step is to count the zeroes. 
Michelle There are 2 zeroes. 20 has 1 zero. And 30 has 1 zero.
emily Thank you Miss. Michelle. And finally for the last step. Miss. Evangeline?
Evangeline the final step is to put the zeroes on. The final answer is a 6 with 2 zeroes. The answer is 600. 
Lucas Does that mean 30 times 40 equals 1200 because 3 times 4 = 12 and there are 2 extra zeroes?
Michelle Great job Lucas.
Lucas I get it!
hx I dont get it. Why does this trick work?
daniel because it does
daniel excellent explanation mr. daniel!
daniel thank you mr. daniel!
hx i still dont get it
alvin dont worry hx. You will get it. You just have to do it a few times.
hx are you sure?
alvin I’m positive.
Grace Can we do another example?
Daniel Of course Grace.
Daniel What is 9 billion times 200?
Grace 9 billion is the same as 9,000,000,000. 
Lucas The first step is to do 9 times 2 which is 18.
hx The second step is to count the zeroes. There are 11 zeroes.
Grace finally, we put it all together. The answer is 1,800,000,000,000.
ev great job everyone!
