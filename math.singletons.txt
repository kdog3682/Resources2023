Carrying Cupcakes

Shujing, Ivy, and Sandy have a cupcake shop.
They bake the cakes at home, and then bring them to the shop.

Normally, they always carry the same amount.
For example, Shujing will carry 20, Ivy will carry 20, and Sandy will carry 20.

One day, Shujing stayed home to watch the International Pickle Eating Competition. As a result, Ivy and Sandy both had to carry more.

If Ivy carried 60 cupcakes that day, how many cupcakes would Ivy have had to carry if Shujing didn't stay at home?

60 * 2 / 3
