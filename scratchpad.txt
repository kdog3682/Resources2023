Adding and Subtracting Decimals

It is just like regular addition and subtraction.
The only difference is there is a dot.

2.3 - 1.1

Basically, this question is the same as 23 - 11.

23 - 11 = 12.

So for 2.3 - 1.1, the answer will be 12 with 1 decimal point.
The answer is 1.2.

Example 2
23.45
12.34

When you do this question, 
Do it just like normal addition.

When you come to the decimal point, write the decimal point, and then keep going.


Example 3

23.45
12.34
11.00
12.34

It looks scary, but just take it one column at a time.
It's just normal addition with an extra decimal dot.

Multiplying Decimals


Before we do multiplying decimals, let's review 

What does 2 million times 3 million equal?

2,000,000 times 3,000,000.

Step 1. Take out lots of extra paper because these are really big numbers.

But I don't have any extra scratch paper.

In that case, we will have to do it in our heads.

Step 1. Do 2 times 3.

2 times 3 = 6.

Step 2. Count up all the zeroes.

There are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 zeroes in total.
The first 2 million has 6 zeroes. 
The second 2 million has 6 zeroes.

Step 3. Put it all together.

Does that mean the final answer is 6 with 12 zeroes?

That's correct $.
The answer is 6,000,000,000,000. (pronounced 6 trillion)

What does 10 times 200 times 3,000 equal?

This question looks scary, but it's not.
Forget about the zeroes.
Put them into your pocket.

But I don't have any pockets.

Fine. Put them into your backpack.

Okay, they are in my backpack. 

Now, do 1 times 2 times 3.

That equals 6.

Now take the zeroes out of your backpack, and put them back onto the 6.

In total, there is 1 zero from the 10, 2 zeroes from 200, and 3 zeroes from 3000. That's 6 zeroes.

The final answer is 6 with 6 zeroes also known as 6 million. (6,000,000)



a * b





This is the exception.
